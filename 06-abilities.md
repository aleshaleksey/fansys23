## Ability Basics

**Abilities** are special actions that a character can take outside of the core actions available to all characters (covered in "Combat", "Movement and Exploration", and "Skills"). Abilities are often more potent than the core actions, but these also come at a cost of consuming SP dice and MP dice, so use them with care. Importantly, magic is covered at the end of this chapter.

**Boons** are traits that enhance a character beyond what it would otherwise be. For example, a boon might grant resistance to "percussive" damage, or allow a character to move faster, or breath under water, or attack more than once during a "main action".

The line between "boons" and "abilities" is a fine one, but in general "abilities" are something that is actively used, (eg, "I use elemental touch", "I use far throw"), while a boon is something that is used passively (eg "I have skirmisher so I move behind the enemy where I am flanking and you don't get an attack of opportunity.").

Each category is split up into "combat", "exploration" or "general". The categories are not perfect but they cover most bases relatively well.

___
### Prerequisites

Some abilities and boons have prerequisites. These are there to balance the game, but also to make sense: How does one learn an advanced ability when one does not know the basics? A character that loses a prerequisite for an ability or boon cannot use the ability or boon until that prerequisite is restored.

The most common prerequisites are a minimum [Base], a minimum level, or a minimum total of SP or MP dice.

___
### Max dice per level

For combat and general abilities the number of dice used per single ability is equal to half the character's level rounded up. For global magic there is no limit.

___
### Rating

All abilities and boons are rated "C" through "S" class. "C" is considered 'weakest', while 'S' is considered strongest (although this does not necessarily determine general usefulness). This is used mostly for the creation of templates, but also as a guideline for determining prerequisites.

___
### Recursive Abilities

If an ability or boon somehow grants the character that possesses it more uses, or additional forms of the same ability, then these additional forms or uses are not gained. Usually this a supernatural ability like [Alternate Form](#alternate-form-i-iv) or [Spellcasting](#spellcasting). Thus if a spell gives you more 

___
### Declaration

Unless otherwise stated an ability must be declared and any cost paid upfront before any rolls are made.

## Active Abilities (Natural)

This list contains the active abilities which are not supernatural, though some may appear so to the untrained eye. In order to use these abilities the player (or DM) must make a declaration, and usually use some kind of action.

___
#### Assassinate I-V

**Description**: A character can take advantage of moments of weakness to make a strike that bypasses a target's defences. Damage from this deadly ability is dealt directly to the target's HP.

**Action:** Declare "assassinate" and make the attack.

**Offence**:

- Exertion: Yes.
- Range: Weapon range, but no more than 30ft + 5ft/[assassinate level]
- Duration: Instantaneous.
- Action: "main action".
- Target: 1.
- Attack: Weapon attack.
- Damage: Weapon damage (directly vs HP).
- Dice: None.

**Prerequisites**:

- Precision attack III.
- Character level of at least [Assassinate level] x 4

**Special**:

- You can only make one attack as your main action when using "assassinate".
- The target must affected by at least one of the conditions that your assassinate level qualifies you for. For example at "Assassinate I", it must be "immobilised", at "Assassinate 3" it must be "immobilised", or "surprised" or "stunned".
- Assassinate automatically fails if the target has heavy, or total, concealment, or if it is "invisible" to you. This means that, for example, entities without low light vision, or other special sight, cannot use "assassinate" with ranged attacks in low light conditions or darkness.
- If "assassinate" is used with a ranged attack, it must be within the first range increment of the weapon. 
- Since it uses a "main action" it cannot be used as a "reaction".
- You cannot use "assassinate" when in conjunction with "Berserk" and similar abilities.

|Assassinate level|Exploited Condition|Minimum Level|
|-|-|-|
|I|Immobilised|4 (5)|
|II|+Stunned|8|
|III|+Surprised (or unaware)|12|
|IV|+Incapacitated|16|
|V|+Restrained/Blinded|20|

___
#### Bard Song I-IV

**Type**: C-A, natural.

**Description**: Use song, oratory or instrumental skills to strongly influence emotions of listeners, hence providing a boon, such as warding off negative conditions (resistance), and, at higher levels of the ability, gaining advantage on a single roll.

**Action**: Declare bard song as a "secondary action" and expend 1 SP dice, make a ["perform"](05-skills.md#perform) roll to determine range (see below). Each subsequent turn use a "secondary action" to maintain bard song and reroll "perform" (no additional expenditure of SP is required). The song can be maintained for a number of rounds equal to your Con score.

**Range**: ["perform" roll result] x 5ft.

**Targets**: All allied entities within range that can hear the song.

**Effect**: Each targets within range that can hear the song gain resistance to requisite conditions ("frightened", "catatonic", "incapacitated", "paralysed",depending on bard song level). In addition each affected entity in range gains the following benefits:

- It can add its [base](02-base-rules.md#base) to a single roll per round while it can hear the song.
- It may gain advantage on a single roll per song (see "prerequisite table" below).

**Limitations**:

- A character that is "aphonic", "silenced", or otherwise cannot produce sound cannot use "bard song".
- A character that is "deafened" or otherwise cannot perceive sound cannot be affected by "bard song".

**Special**: On a perform roll of 24 or higher, a resistance of the performer's choice becomes an immunity for the duration of the song.

**Prerequisites table**:

|Bard Song Level|Perform Ranks|Resistance|Advantage|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|1|"frightened"|-|
|II|3|"catatonic"|1 skill roll per song|
|III|5|"incapacitated"|1 skill roll or save per song|
|IV|7|"paralysed"|1 skill roll or save or attack roll per song|

___
#### Berserk I-V

**Description**: You enter a trance of violence, enhancing combat prowess at the cost of stressing the physical form past its limits.

**Action**: Declare berserk as a "secondary action".

**Effect**: A character enters a berserker trance.

- A character can remain in the trance for a number of rounds equal to its SP dice total, or 6 rounds, whichever is greater. The character can leave the trance voluntarily as a secondary action.
- The character gains a number of SP equal to their SP dice maximum. In addition the character has a bonus to walk, climb, swim and fly speed, weapon damage, and may have advantage on attacks (See the berserker table).

**Special**:

- Berserk does not have an SP dice cost. However, when the berserker trance is over, you lose a number of HP equal to the level of the Berserk ability (so for "Berserk I" you lose 1HP: see table below).
- At the end of the trance you lose the SP that was gained at the start of the berserker trance. If this would leave the character with negative SP, the character's SP drops to zero, and the character instead loses a number of HP equal to its [base]. For example, a character with [base]=2 (levels 6-10) would lose 2 HP in this case. This HP loss is IN ADDITION to the normal HP loss that occurs regardless at the end of the trance.
- While "berserk", a character may not use INT based skills and has disadvantage on all WIS and CHA based skills with the exception of ["Observe"](05-skills.md#observe). It has disadvantage on ["Tinker"](05-skills.md#tinker) rolls.
- While "berserk", a character cannot cast spells with a kinetic component and must roll a 1d6 when trying to cast spells with an incantation component, losing the spell on a 3 or lower.
- While "berserk", a character may not use abilities such as "precision attack".

**Berserk Table**:

|Level|SP dice prerequisite|Speed|Attack   |Damage|HP loss on end|Extra|
|-----|--------------------|-----|---------|------|--------------|-----|
|I    |3                   |-    |normal   |+2    |1             |-    |
|II   |9                   |+5   |normal   |+3    |2             |Advantage vs "frightened"|
|III  |18                  |+10  |normal   |+4    |3             |Advantage vs "grappled" & "restrained"|
|IV   |28                  |+15  |advantage|+5    |4             |Advantage vs vs "Charmed"|
|V    |40                  |+20  |advantage|+6    |5             |Advantage vs "stunned" & "incapacitated"|

**Cost**: [1 SP die + 1 SP die per 5ft of reach of the weapon] are expended. Thus for a weapon with 5ft reach, the cost is 2 SP dice, for a weapon with 10ft reach the cost is 3 SP dice, etc.

**Original state**: Ordinary broad strike only hits adjacent targets.

**Prerequisites**:

- 21 SP dice
- STR or DEX of 17
- "Broad Strike"

**Special**: Unlike broad strike, this ability uses a main action rather than a single attack.

___
#### Combined Manoeuvre I-V

**Description**: Combine two or more different "basic combat manoeuvre"s in one attack.

**Cost**: This is an exerting activity. For each manoeuvre combined one SP dice is expended.

|Number of Manoeuvres combined|SP dice cost|

____
#### Debilitating Strike

**Description**: Expend 1-3 SP dice to induce a condition when making an unarmed strike or a melee attack with a "light" weapon. For each new condition the ability must be taken again.

**Action**:

2. If you hit, expend the SP dice.
3. The target must succeed a CON save against your WIS o INT threshold (as you choose), at the start of its turn.
3. On a fail, the target is affected until the end of its *next* turn.

___
#### Deflect Missile

**Type**: (Class B)

**Description**: Reduce damage from ranged attacks that do hit when you use ["parry"](#parry).

**Action**: When you use parry to deflect a ranged weapon attack, and the attack hits and does damage, you may declare "Deflect Missile". The effect is as follows:

- If a ranged weapon attack would hit anyway, despite being parried, the *physical* damage is reduced by the roll of your [melee attack damage] + [NAP]. Thus if you hold a greatsword, and your melee damage is 2d6+4 and your NAP is 5, then the damage of that ranged attack is reduced by 2d6+9.
- If you fail a DEX save to evade a natural projectile (eg rockfall, or an arrow trap) when your declaration of parry is in effect, you can chose to deflect it, with the same effect as if you were deflecting a ranged weapon attack.

**Limitation**: "Deflect Missile" can only be used vs ONE attack per round, no matter how many attacks a character may try to parry.

**Original state**: If the roll for a ranged attack exceeds your HiT, it hits and can do damage.

|20|10|Far Throw II|
|25|18|Far Throw III|
|30|28|Far Throw IV|
|35|40|Far Throw V|

**Original state**: The "throw" manoeuvre moves tha target 10ft + 5ft x size advantages.

___
#### Flash Step

**Description**: As a "secondary action" move up to your base speed per SP dice expended. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. While moving like this your jump distance is increased by 10ft per SP dice spent and you are not affected by difficult terrain.

**Special**:

- This ability must be taken separately for each movement modality.
- Flash step cannot be used with "dig" speed, "swim" speed or "cosmic" speed.

**Limitation**:

- Flash Step cannot be used when wearing heavy armour.
- The SP dice cost of Flash Step is doubled when wearing medium armour.

**Prerequisites**: 6 SP dice and 4 MP dice total.

___
#### Flurry

___
#### Great Strike

**Description**: Sacrifice precision for power when making melee attacks. (Swing like a helicopter).

**Action**: When making an attack with a melee weapon that is governed by STR, take a penalty up to your [Nat] to your attack roll and take the same number as a bonus to your damage if you hit. If the weapon is a two-handed ["heavy weapon"](11-weapons-armour.md#weapon-properties), the bonus to damage is doubled.

___
#### Greater Manoeuvre I-V

**Description**: Increase size gap where "Grapple", "Restrain", "Shove", "Throw" and "Trip" still work by 1. In addition characters with this ability have a smaller threshold increase per size category difference for size dependant manoeuvres: +2 instead of +4.

**Prerequisites**: For every extra size category, this ability must be taken again.

|Size difference|SP dice total|Ability name|
|-|-|-|
|3|4|Greater Manoeuvre I|
|4|10|Greater Manoeuvre II|
|5|18|Greater Manoeuvre III|
|6|28|Greater Manoeuvre IV|
|7|40|Greater Manoeuvre V|

**Original state**: The above manoeuvres do not work on targets more than two categories larger than yourself.

___
#### Guardian's Counterstrike

**Description**: Your counterstrike can be triggered by attacks against any entity in your reach, not just yourself.

**Prerequisite**: 10 SP dice + ["Counterstrike"](#counterstrike).

**Original state**: Counterstrike is triggered only by attacks against yourself.

___
#### Parry

**Type**: (Class A)

**Description**: Add your [Nat] to your HiT (shield[parry] bonus) against a number of melee attacks.

**Action**: Use as your reaction on an enemy's turn vs ONE weapon attack. Alternatively declare on your turn and give up your reaction to make a number of parries up to 2 + your multi-attack level.

___
#### Precision attack I-X

- You can only make one weapon attack when using "precision attack".
- The target must be unaware of you, "surprised", or be in melee range of another entity hostile to it. OR you must have advantage on your attack.
- Precision attack automatically fails if the target has heavy concealment or total concealment, or if it is "invisible" to you. (It is impossible to make a precision attack if you cannot carefully observe your target). This means that, for example, entities without low light vision, or other special sight, cannot use "precision attack" with ranged attacks in low light conditions or darkness.
- If "precision attack" is used with a ranged attack, it must be within the first range increment of the weapon. 
- Since it uses a "main action" it cannot be used as a "reaction".

**Prerequisite table**: Precision attack has 10 levels. The maximum level of precision attack a character may have is [Level / 2] (so I at level 2, II at level 4, etc..).

___
#### Rapid Shot

**Type**: (Natural, Class B)

**Description**: Make a targeted weapon attack against the attacking foe upon successfully parrying (once per round).

**Action**: Once per round, when your character uses "[parry](#parry)" and a melee attack is made against them and does not meet their HiT, the character may immediately make a single weapon attack (or other basic combat manoeuvre) against the attacking entity. The riposte is considered to be part of your parry for the sake of action economy and is essentially a "non-action".

**Prerequisites**: 11 SP dice + "Counterstrike" + "Parry"

### Active Abilities (Supernatural)

This section contains a listing of active abilities which are supernatural in nature. The use of these abilities generally requires a declaration by the player (or the DM) who control the character.

___
#### Alternate Form I-IV

**Type**: (Class C-A, Supernatural)

**Description**: The character has a second physical form and can change between its first form and its other form as a main action. The exact form is chosen when taking the ability and can be changed upon reaching levels 6, 11 and 16, or at other level ups with consensus of the group.

**Action**: Declare "alternate form" and use a main action to transform.

**Prerequisites**:

- At least one level of [spellcasting](07-magic-and-spellcasting.md#the-7-types-of-magic) belonging to any the categories of  "air", "nature" or "water".
- 7 MP dice.

**Table**:

|Ability Level|Min Base|Max Size  |Permitted Types               |Allowed Modalities|
|-------------|--------|----------|------------------------------|------------------|
|I            |1       |Medium    |Beast, Humanoid               |Walk, Swim, Climb |
|II           |2       |Large     |As I + Plant, Monster         |As I + Fly, Dig   |

|IV           |4       |Gargantuan|As III + Fiend, Angel         |As III + Blink    |

**Special**:

- The alternate form is always the same. For example, if a character transforms into a cat, it is always the same cat.
- A character with alternate form can ignore the transformative effects of spells such as ["Least Transformation"](08-spell-list.md#least-transformation) and ["Bestial Transformation"](08-spell-list.md#bestial-transformation) by using their main action to transform back into one of their forms.
- If some abilities/properties of a chosen form is sealed at a lower level of alternate form, they become unlocked upon reaching the correct level of "alternate form".
- When a character transforms, its physical stats, movement modalities, and properties that depend on the physical form of the new form are replaced (this includes resistances and senses). Mental stats and supernatural abilities are not affected. SP dice, MP, MP dice, and HP are not affected.
- A character returns to its original form when it dies, but not necessarily when it is merely unconscious.
- A character can *be returned* to its original form by dispelling the alternate form, [as per the dispelling rules](07-magic-and-spellcasting.md#banishing-breaking-counter-spelling-and-dispelling). If the alternate form is dispelled, the character cannot use "Alternate Form" for a number of turns equal to the difference between the dispel roll and threshold. For example, if the Threshold=18, and the dispelling character rolls a 23, the shapeshifter cannot return to its alternate form for 5 rounds.

**Limitations**:

- The alternate form chosen cannot be a higher level than the initial character. Thus a level 6 character with "Alternate Form II" cannot chose the form of a [kraken](monsters-npcs/monsters-and-dragons.md#sea-monster-kraken-lesser), as it is a higher level.
- If the difference in CON between the two forms would increase, or decrease, the SP maximum, SP changes by the difference. For example if a character has +2 [CON], but its alternate form has +3 [CON] and the character has 6 SP dice and a level of 3, its main form would have 18 SP, and its alternate form would have 21 SP. Thus if a character fights in its alternate form and is reduced to 9/21 SP, when it returns to the main form, it would have 6/18 SP. If it has 2/21 SP it will return to 0/18 and take 1 HP damage.
- Switching between forms does not use SP or MP dice. However, when a character has 0 MP or 0 MP dice, it cannot switch between forms.
- Switching between forms does not in any way affect equipment or items carried by the character. Equipment that is incompatible with the character's may be shed or damaged.
- If the entity that is chosen as the alternate form *itself* has the "Alternate Form" ability, then this ability is not inherited.

This ability is potentially broken and should only be included in a game by consensus within the group.

___
#### Alternate Form: Swift Transformation

**Type**: (Class B, Supernatural)

**Description**: A character with alternate form can transform as a "secondary action" instead of as a "main action". 

**Original state**: Transformation requires a "main action".

**Prerequisite**: [Alternate Form I](#alternate-form-i-iv)

___
#### Alternate Form: Sequester

**Type**: (Class A, Supernatural)

**Description**: A character with alternate form can choose whether their equipment and carried items are affected by their transformation or not.

**Original state**: Equipment is not affected by the transformation of "alternate form". Equipment that is incompatible with the character's may be shed, damaged.

**Prerequisite**: [Alternate Form II](#alternate-form-i-iv)

**Special**:

- All of a character's equipment is affected in the same way.
- A character may chose whether equipment:
  - Is sequestered inside them (it still counts against carrying capacity).
  - Changes size to fit the size of the new form, this also changes its weight as per the [size table](02-base-rules.md#size-rules-table). This is useful when switching between similar forms of the same size.
  - Is not affected by the transformation, and may be shed or in worst case scenarios, damaged.

(Technically this is a boon)

___
#### Arcane Interception

**Type**: (Supernatural, A)

**Description**: You can use the "interception" manoeuvre to redirect supernatural attacks that require a saving throw at yourself.

**Original state**: "Intercept" manoeuvre can only be used to intercept attacks that require an attack roll (targeted attacks).

**Action**: As a "main action":

- Declare a target to protect. You must be within reach of your mark, or the direct line between the attacker and target must pass through your square.
- When a supernatural attack that requires a saving throw is made against your mark before the start of your next turn, it is automatically redirected at you, and you make the save and/or potentially suffer the effect.

As a "reaction": This works in the same way as the "main action" mode, however you can only defend your target against one such attack.

**Limitation**: You can only protect a single target against area of effect attacks, or attacks that would affect multiple targets.

**Prerequisites**:

- Proficiency with the "interception" manoeuvre.
- At least one rank in any of: "Knowledge: Arcana", "Knowledge: Religion", or "Spellworking".
- At least one level of any "local" [spellcasting](#spellcasting-local) ability.

___
#### Bind Beast I-X

**Type**: A Class (I-V), S Class (VI-X).

**Description**: Bind an "animal" or "monster" to accompany and serve you. Mystics often use bound monsters as guardians.

**Action:**

- Exertion: Yes.
- Range: 30ft.
- Duration: Instantaneous.
- Action: 1 hour ritual.
- Target: A single "animal" or "monster" which must remain within 30ft of you for the duration of the ritual.
- Attack: None
- Damage: None
- Cost: 1 MP dice per level of beast.

**Benefits**: A bound beast may not disobey you and acts as a loyal servant, this does not mean, however that it necessarily likes it.

- A bound beast understands your commands and can be commanded in and out of battle with a "communicate" action. No "creature handling" check is required.
- Such a beast can be used for combat, scouting, guarding and other menial tasks within its capability.
- Once a command has been issued, the beast will continue to perform the action until it completes the instructions. Thus if it is commanded "attack the bandit" it will continue to do so until called off, while if it is commanded to "give the bandit a bite", it will continue until it has succeeded in biting the bandit once.
- If a command is physically or conceptually impossible for it, it may either do nothing, or do something similar to the best of its interpretation (which might cause problems).

**Limitations**:

- You must find a suitable beast and keep it still for long enough to bind it. It can attempt a Cha save vs your [Sup + [Cha]] to not be bound. You cannot attempt to bind the same beast for a month if it succeeds. If it succeeds three times, you can never bind it.
- If a beast has a higher level than your "Bind Beast" limit, you cannot bind it.
- If you do something, or order the beast to do something that would normally make it a "nemesis" (see ["Skills: Persuade"](05-skills.md#persuade)), it gets a Cha save vs your [Sup + [Cha]] at advantage to break the binding.
- You can never have more than one bound beast at a time.
- You must sacrifice 1HP of your own to the beast every day to keep it bound. Sacrificing another character's HP transfers the beast to their control for the day: Every day this is done the beast gets a Cha save vs the temporary master's [Sup + [Cha]] to break free.

**Rules**:

- If the beast's attack, damage dice, HP, SP or MP are greater than the values displayed on the table, they are reduced to that value.
- If the beast's attack, damage dice, HP, SP or MP are lower than the values displayed on the table, they are increased to the value.
- If its movement modalities are too high, it looses them until your "Bind Beast" level reaches a point where it is high enough. If the beast does not have these modalities, it does NOT gain them.
- The beast retains its HiT and uses your base save bonuses.
- The beast loses all abilities that exceed the max permitted class.
- The beast may serve as a mount if it can carry you.
- If the beast is of a *lower* level than the bind beast ability level, it can be levelled up to the bind beast level. This is done as follows:
  1. Assign 2 SP and 1 MP dice per level gained. Do not change HP, MP, SP, as this is determined by the table below.
  2. Pick 2 natural boons or abilities from this chapter for which the beast meets the prerequisites.
  - Alternatively, if the beast has a stat block for more than one level, upgrade the beast to the highest available stat block (eg [velociraptors](monsters-npcs/beasts-and-plants.md#raptor-levels-2-4) have a stat block for levels 2 and 4).

**Prerequisite**: You must have at least one level of "global" or "incantation" or "nature" magic to gain this ability.

(**Key**: W - walk, C - climb, S - swim, D - dig, F - fly, B - blink)

1. A beast may use dig and fly modalities even at Bind Beast I and II, if its size category is no larger than small, and also no larger than the character that bound it.

___
#### Bind Familiar I-IV

- Range: Your reach (usually 5ft).
- Duration: Instantaneous.
- Action: 1 hour ritual.

- Attack: None
- Damage: None
- Cost: 3 MP dice

**Benefits**: A familiar allows a spellcaster several benefits:

- A familiar can give advise (although it is often bad advise!).
- A familiar gives a "supernatural" bonus equal to the "Bind Familiar" level (must be chosen when the familiar is first bound) when the familiar is within 10ft of the binder, to one of the following:
  - "spellworking" rolls when working with global spells and to your threshold for global spells 
  - "concentration" saves to maintain spells.
  - "Knowledge:Arcana" rolls.
- A familiar can deliver spells and messages.
- A familiar can scout.
- A familiar (at higher levels) can also use "basic martial manoeuvres".

**Limitations**: A familiar has certain limitations.

- A familiar's vessel must be an animal of size "tiny" or "small".
- If a familiar's vessel is killed, it cannot be given a new vessel till the next day.
- A character can ONLY have one familiar.

**Rules**:

- A familiar has an intelligence of 5 + [Bind Familiar level] x 2.
- A familiar has HP, MP, and SP dependant on the "Bind Familiar" level.
- A familiar retains the HiT of its base creature but uses your saves, has resistance to damage based on the spellcasting that was used as a prerequisite to bind it.
- A familiar has an empathic link with its binder to a distance based on the "Bind familiar" level.

**Prerequisites**: To bind a familiar the entity must have at least one "spellcasting" ability.

**Familiar tables**:

|Ability Level|MP dice minimum|Max Vessel Level|HP|SP|MP|Int|Link range|Can Attack|

___
#### Charm I-IV

**Type**: (Class B-S)

**Description**: Expend MP dice to attempt to ["charm"](10-conditions-types.md#charmed) one or more targets as a "main action".

**Action**: Declare "charm" and your target as a main action and expend the requisite number of MP dice. The target must succeed a WIS save vs your INT threshold. If it fails it is charmed for the full duration.

**Exertion**: Yes.

**Limitation**:

- You must have line of sight to your target and your target must be aware of you.
- The effect ends if the you or an entity perceived by the target as your ally attacks (or applies a harmful effect) the target. Likewise the spell ends if the target is commanded to attack or apply a harmful effect to itself, unless it is already inclined to do so.
- The target is not necessarily aware that it has been charmed, unless it succeeds a "knowledge:arcana" roll to identify the effect.
- On a failed save, a target that has successfully identified the source of the effect with a successful "knowledge:arcana" roll (and only one that has successfully identified the source of the effect) may choose to deal HP damage to itself to end the effect (if it has the capacity to do so). The damage dealt must be equal or greater than your level.
- "Divine" or "entropic" damage dealt to the target immediately ends the effect, regardless to whether it is aware that it is charmed or not.

**Special**:

- Charm I and II: If the target succeeds its save by 12 or more, you are charmed by the target.
- A mortal attempting to charm a "[divine](10-conditions-types.md#divine-1), must make a CHA save vs the target's threshold, or be charmed instead.
- You can extend the effect as a non-action, however, the target does get to roll a new CHA save. Every time the effect is extended in this way, the target gains a +1 bonus to the save. If the effect is allowed to expire, and you attempt to charm the same target again, the bonus to the save is reset.

**Table**:

|Charm Level|Prerequisites         |MP dice cost      |Range|Maximum duration|Maximum number of targets|
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|-----|----------------|-------------------------|
|I          |6 MP dice             |2 per target      |Close|1 hour          |1                        |

___
### Elementalism (Elemental Blast)

Elementalism is the supernatural ability to project the elements violently from one's being, be it fire, ice, or something else. It differs from spellcasting in that it is the barely controlled projection of raw energies, which is generally destructive.

When a character first gains the "elementalism" ability for an element, they choose one of the following 'elements':

- Air
- Earth
- Fire
- Ice
- Light (aspects of air and fire)
- Lightning (aspect of air, water and fire)

A character then picks one of the following two forms:

- Touch
- Blast (+ Cone)

Subsequently, when a character gains the "elementalism" ability again, they may may either pick additional ["forms"](#forms) and ["effects"](#effects) for an elementalism they already possess, or begin again with a new [element](#elements). The "elementalism" ability can be taken any number of times, as long as prerequisites are met.

Thus an aspiring elementalist may expend one level point to gain "Elementalism: Air, Blast" and then at a higher level spend another level point to gain the "Prone" effect for it. Then, later still, the same character may spend another level point to take the "Elementalism: Air, Circle". At this point, this elementalist would be able to shoot air blasts targetting a single target, cones of air targetting a small area, or blasts of air that scour wide areas. Lastly this elementalist would be able to modify any of these elemental air blasts to knock affected targets prone.

___
#### Basics

**Type**: (Class C-S, supernatural)

**Offence:**

- Exertion: Yes, if used offensively.
- Range: Special (see).
- Duration: Instantaneous.
- Action: "main action".
- Target: Varies (see below).
- Attack: [SAP + [WIS]]
- Damage:
  - [[Base]d8 + [WIS]] natural percussive/shear (earth).
  - [[Base]d8 + [WIS]] natural pressure (air).
  - [[Base]d6 + [WIS]] (fire or ice).
  - [[Base]d4 + [WIS]] for lightning or light.
- Dice: MP (base dice cost = 0).
- Per dice: 1 extra damage die / MP die.

**Special**:

- Elementalism requires at least one prehensile appendage to function properly. When a character is "crippled" on all arms, "restrained", "immobilised", *wielding* items in both arms, or otherwise does not have prehensile appendages available, the attack for elementalism are at disadvantage. Likewise, in this situation the saving throw against it (if any) is at advantage.
- On the other hand, if the form is "touch", "sweep" or "aura" and the target is in direct contact with the elementalist (eg grappling or being grappling), the attack is at advantage. Likewise any saving throw against the elementalism is at disadvantage.
- In areas aligned with the given element, the elementalism gains an additional damage die.
- In areas aligned with an opposite element, the elementalism loses a damage die.
- If the elemental form does not require an attack roll, but instead triggers a save there is no damage on a successful save. However, if more than 4 MP dice are expended in total, then, on a successful save, the elementalism still causes half damage.

**Limitations**: Elementalism originates from the user and travels more or less in a straight line, unaffected by wind or gravity. The blast is affected by cover and concealment. If the blast impacts cover, it may damage, ignite, or have other affects on it (see below).

___
#### Elements

An elementalism can only have one form, which is selected before any rolls are made. An elementalism must have an element.

|Element|Damage dice|Damage Type|Save Type|Extra Properties|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Air|D8|percussive/shear [natural]|STR|Causes damage to structures and objects affected|
|Earth|D8|pressure [natural]|STR|See below|
|Fire|D6|fire [supernatural]|CON|See below|
|Ice|D6|cold [supernatural]|CON|*Will** freeze 1 gallon of water, + 1 gallon / MP dice.|
|Light|D4|light [supernatural]|CHA|Sheds light (visibility 5 miles, illumination: bright/dim 10ft, 20ft)|
|Lightning|D4|lightning [supernatural]|CON|See below|

- Elementalism "earth" will:
  - Cause damage to structures and objects affected.
  - Transform terrain into difficult terrain where touched
- Elementalism "fire" will:
  - Heat objects up to 10lb + 10lb / MP dice.
  - Shed light (visibility: 1 mile, illumination: dim, 10ft).
  - Ignite flammable materials.
- Elementalism "lightning" will:
  - Shed light (visibility: 1 mile, illumination: dim, 10ft).
  - Ignite flammable materials.

An elementalism for each element can be enhanced with the following effects/conditions. The effect is declared before any rolls are made. An elementalism does not require an effect, and many elementalists prefer simpler elementalisms with only an element and form.

|Effect       |Element Prerequisite  |Other Prerequisites|MP die cost|
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|
|Prone        |Air or Earth          |-                  |1          |
|Shove (10ft) |Air or Earth          |-                  |1          |
|Aphonic      |Air or Lightning      |-                  |1          |
|Deafened     |Air or Lightning      |-                  |1          |
|Glowing      |Light                 |-                  |1          |
|Frightened   |Fire or Lightning     |Base = 2           |1          |
|Blinded      |Fire, Light, Lightning|Base = 2           |2          |
|Incapacitated|Fire or Lightning     |Base = 2           |2          |
|Restrained   |Ice or Earth          |Base = 2           |2          |
|Catatonic    |Light or Fire         |Base = 2           |2          |

The "shove" and "prone" effect are immediate and do not require repeated save. The remaining effects persist for up 1 minute, and allow a save at the end of each of the target's turns.

___
#### Forms

An elementalism must have a form and only ever one form, which must be selected before any rolls are made. There are two primary forms "Touch" and "Blast" (Cone is automatically available with a given element if a character knows blast). Other forms are derived as follows:

- Primary: Touch.
  - Derived: Sweep, Aura
- Primary: Blast.
  - Derived: Line, Circle, Chain, Arc.

The forms are summarised as follows:

|Form           |Prerequisite           |MP dice cost       |Range|Roll         |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----|-------------|
|Touch          |3 MP dice              |-                  |close|Melee Attack |
|Sweep          |Form: Touch, 5 MP dice |+1 per target      |close|Melee Attack |
|Aura           |From: Touch, 7 MP dice |+1 per 10ft        |self |Save         |
|Touch, Enhanced|Form: Touch, 7 MP dice |-                  |close|Melee Attack |
|               |                       |                   |     |             |
|Blast          |3 MP dice              |-                  |120ft|Ranged Attack|
|Cone           |Form: Touch or Blast   |+1 per 10ft length |10ft |Save         |
|Line           |Form: Blast, 12 MP dice|+1 per 5ft  width  |120ft|Save         |
|Circle         |From: Blast, 15 MP dice|+1 per 10ft (rad)  |120ft|Save         |
|Chain          |Form: Line, 17 MP dice |+1 per turn above 1|120ft|Save         |
|Arc            |From: Line, 19 MP dice |+1 per 30 degrees  |120ft|Save         |

When a "form" prerequisite is present, a character must already have an elementalism of the same element with the given prerequisite form to be able to acquire the new form for that element.

___
#### Foreign Forms

Normally a character with multiple elements takes forms independently for each element. However they may still use the "foreign forms" rule to borrow forms known for one element with other elements:

If a character knows the same "primary form" for multiple elements, they may use any of its "derived form" for any of those elements, at a cost. In order to use a foreign form, the character must expend an MP die. Furthermore, in this case, the number of damage dice dealt is equal to the number of MP dice expended.

For example, if a level 8 character has "Elementalism: Blast" and "Elementalism: Line" for fire, and "Elementalism: Blast" for lightning, they can use "Elementalism: Line" for lightning IF they expend at least one MP die doing so, *however*, the damage with the borrowed "Elementalism: Line (Lightning)" will be **[[MP dice expended]d4 + [WIS]]**, instead of **[[MP dice expended + 2]d4 + [WIS]]**.

___
#### Touch (Elemental Touch)

Imbue your touch with a given element. This can be used either as an attack or for utility purposes.

**Action**: If attacking, make a single melee attack against the target's HiT. On a hit, damage is dealt, and additional effects can be caused.

___
#### Touch, Enhanced

This is an intensification of the usual "touch". The dice size used for your [elemental touch](#touch-elemental-touch) increase by two sizes.

|Original Size|New size|Elements Affected|
|-|-|-|
|D4|D8|Light, Lightning|
|D6|D10|Fire, Ice|
|D8|D12|Air, Earth|

**Action**: As elemental touch.

**Special**: The enhancement of "touch" also affects "sweep", but not "aura" or "cone".

___
#### Sweep

The elemental sweep modifies an elemental touch, striking additional targets adjacent to the wielder as they sweep out an arc.

**Action**: As for elemental touch, but also declare additional adjacent squares. For every additional square affected beyond 2, expend an extra MP die. Regardless of the number of squares affected, a single attack roll vs the target HiT is rolled.

**Limitation**: The damage dice size increase from ["Touch, enhanced"](#touch-enhanced) only applies to one of the targets of elemental sweep.

___
#### Aura

Elemental aura briefly forms an aura of the element that emanates from the wielder.

**Action**: Declare "elemental aura". An aura blooms in a radius centred on the wielder, damaging all entities, objects and structures within a radius of [MP dice spent] x 10ft. These dice are separate from the dice used to increase the damage caused by the blast. All entities caught in the aura must succeed a save (governed by element) or suffer the usual elemental blast damage and effects.

___
#### Blast (Elemental Blast)

Project elemental energy at a single target up to 120ft away.

**Action**: Make a single ranged attack against the target's HiT. On a hit, damage is dealt, and additional effects can be caused.

**Special**:

- For every MP die expended, the range of the blast is increased by 30ft.
- All characters that can use the Blast Form, can also use the "Cone" form.

___
#### Cone

Project elemental energy in a 60 degree cone, emanating from the wielder. Cone is the simplest area of effect form. All characters that can use "blast" can also use the cone form, as "cone" is simply an unshaped, raw projection of elemental energy that can form a blast.

**Action**: Declare "elemental cone". The radius of the cone is 10ft + [10ft x MP dice spent]. These dice are separate from the dice used to increase the damage caused by the blast. All entities caught in the blast must succeed a save (governed by element) or suffer the usual elemental blast damage and effects. The blast blooms around corners to cover the whole area of effect, although entities and objects in cover still gain a bonus to the save.

___
#### Line

Projects elemental energy in a straight line, from the wielder, to the target that effects entities,objects and structures in all intervening squares.

**Action**: Declare "elemental line", choosing a target square and width of at least 5ft (MP dice cost of 1). The width can be increased by 5ft per MP die. These dice are separate from the dice used to increase the damage caused by the blast. All entities caught in the line must succeed the save (governed by element) or suffer the damage. Unlike a cone or circle, the arc does not bloom or circumvent cover.

**Special**: For every MP die spent, the length of the line increases by 30ft.

___
#### Circle

The elemental circle is an elemental blast that blooms into a sphere-like area of effect upon reaching its target.

**Action**: Declare "elemental circle", targeting a square or entity. The elemental blast flies from the wielder to the target square. It then blooms, damaging all entities, objects and structures within a radius of [MP dice spent] x 10ft. These dice are separate from the dice used to increase the damage caused by the blast. All entities caught in the blast must succeed a save (governed by element) or suffer the usual elemental blast damage and effects. The blast blooms around corners to cover the whole area of effect, although entities and objects in cover still gain a bonus to the save.

____
#### Chain

An elemental chain is an elemental line which which has at least one bend in it, allowing it to strike targets off the line, or avoid targets on the original line.

**Action**: Declare "elemental chain". This works as "elemental line", except the wielder may introduce one bend of no more than 90 degrees into the line. For every extra MP die (separate from all other dice), the wielder may add one more bend.

____
#### Arc

This is an enhancement of the "line" form that sweeps out a wide area.

**Action**: Declare "elemental arc". This works like elemental line, except one also chooses an sweep angle and direction. The line sweeps out a 30 degree arc along a plane chosen by the wielder. For every MP die (separate from all other dice), the line may sweep out an extra 30 degrees. Unlike a cone or circle, the arc does not bloom or circumvent cover.


____
### Boons (Natural)

|Level| Max good saves| Boone Name|
|-|-|-|
|1-4|2| Extra Save I|

|13-16|5| Extra Save IV|
|17-20|6| Extra Save V|

___
#### Heat Sense I-V

**Type**: (Natural/Supernatural, Class B)

**Description**: Your vision can detect differences in temperature with pitch black (extreme cold) to blinding white (a blazing fire). You can see warm blooded creatures and other sources of heat even in complete darkness.

**Special**: This ability is blocked as follows:

- At levels I-III: By any solid material thicker than about an inch or by 3ft of water or other liquid.
- At levels IV-V: By 3ft of earth, wood or organic material, or 1ft of stone or metal. It is also blocked by 10ft of water or other liquid.

**Prerequisites**:

|Heat Sense level|Range|MP dice prerequisite|Other|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|15ft|9|-|
|II|30ft|15|Heat Sense I|
|III|45ft|21|Heat Sense II|
|IV|60ft|27|Heat Sense III|
|V|90ft|33|Heat Sense IV|
|VI|120ft|39|Heat Sense V|

**Special**: "Heat sense" is a "supernatural" boon when taken with level points, but can be natural as part of a template or monster block.

___
#### Keen Senses I-III

**Type**: (Supernatural, Class B)

**Description**: Select either sight, smell or hearing. You gain advantage on all "observe" rolls based on this sense.

**Prerequisites**:

|Keen Senses level|MP dice prerequisite|Base prerequisite|Other|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|8|2|-|
|II|16|3|Keen Senses I|
|III|24|4|Keen Senses II?|

**Special**: "Keen senses" is a "supernatural" boon when taken with level points, but can be natural as part of a template or monster block.

___
#### Life Sense I-VI

**Type**: (Supernatural, Class S)

**Description**: You gain the ability to see the life-force of other entities within the range of your "life sense". This sense does not detect "constructs" or "undead".

**Special**:

- Living beings detected by life sense normally do not benefit from concealment vis-a-vis the character with life sense that detected them.
- An entity with life-sense automatically detects living beings in range unless they have full cover as described above, or are concealed or veiled *from this sense* by supernatural means. Additionally, an entity may attempt to hide from life sense amongst/behind *other* living beings.
- Optionally, with a perception roll you can distinguish an entity's type, subtype and race/template/kind (threshold, 12, 16, 24), although a separate knowledge roll may be required to identify this if you are unfamiliar with the type, subtype or template.
- At levels I-III, this ability is blocked by 3ft of earth, wood or organic material, or 1ft of stone or metal.
- At levels IV-VI, this ability is blocked by 6ft of earth, wood or organic material, or 2ft of stone or metal.

**Prerequisites**:

|Life Sense level|Range|MP dice prerequisite|Other|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|15ft|12|-|
|II|30ft|18|Life Sense I|
|III|45ft|24|Life Sense II|
|IV|60ft|30|Life Sense III|
|V|90ft|36|Life Sense IV|
|VI|120ft|42|Life Sense V|

___
#### Low-light Vision

**Type**: (Natural/Supernatural, Class B)

**Description**: You can see in low light conditions (eg a starry night) as if it was daytime. However, you cannot see in pitch black (a sealed cave or the oceanic abyss). A character with low-light vision treats dim light (such as the illumination between the "bright" and "dim" radius of a torch) as bright light, it will then treat a radius twice that as dim light. Thus if the "dim light" radius of a torch ends within 40ft, a character with "low-light vision" would see within 40ft of the torch as if it were in bright light, and between 40-80ft as if it were in dim light.

**Prerequisites**: 15 MP dice.

**Special**: "Low-light vision" is a "supernatural" boon when taken with level points, but can be natural as part of a template or monster block.

___
#### Mental Fight

**Type**: (Supernatural)

**Description**: The following abilities are "supernatural" and go off MP dice and SAP (instead of SP dice and NAP):

+ Flurry
+ Unarmed Strike I-IX
+ Debilitating Strike
+ Flash Step

**Prerequisites**:

+ SP dice total of at least 7.
+ MP dice total of at least 7.
+ Any 3 of "Flurry", "Unarmed Strike", "Debilitating Strike" and "Flash Step".

**Special**: Prerequisites for further improvements of these abilities are also transferred to MP dice total. You still use Str/Dex to make the attack (SAP + [Dex]/[Str]).

**Warning**: This is a bit niche and build dependant. It is here as homage to the belief that these abilities can be either "natural" or "supernatural". It does not necessarily improve the build.

___
#### Resist Condition

**Type**: (Natural/Supernatural, Class B-S)

**Description**: Gain resistance to one condition (advantage on saves vs condition, disadvantage on combat manoeuvres vs a character that is resistant).

**Prerequisites**:

|Resistance|Base|Dice|Other|
|-|-|-|-|
|Poisoned|-|10 SP|-|
|Diseased|-|10 SP|-|
|Prone|-|8 SP|-|
|Grappled|-|8 SP|-|
|Glowing|-|8 MP|-|
|Deafened|-|8 SP|-|
|Aphonia|-|8 SP|-|
|Frightened|2|-|-|
|Restrained|2|-|Grappled|
|Charmed|2|-|-|
|Blinded|2|-|-|
|Bleeding|2|-|-|
|Crippled|2|-|-|
|Stunned|3|-|-|
|Incapacitated|3|-|-|
|Immobilised|3|-|Restrained|
|Paralysed|3|-|-|
|Catatonic|3|-|Charmed or Frightened|
|Unconscious|3|-|-|

___
#### Resist Damage

**Type**: (Natural/Supernatural, Class B-S)

**Description**: Gain resistance to one damage type.

**Prerequisites**:

|Resistance|Base|Dice|
|-|-|-|
|Any one ["Physical"](10-conditions-types.md#physical-damage)|-|10 SP|
|Poison|-|12 MP or SP|
|Fire|2|-|
|Ice|2|-|
|Necrotic|2|-|
|Lightning|3|-|
|Light|3|-|
|Divine|4|30 MP|
|Entropic|4|36 MP|
|Profane|4|-|

___
#### Second Soul

**Type**: (Supernatural, Class A, cost = 2 points)

**Description**: A second nascent soul dwells within the character's body, bringing benefits and drawbacks.

**Prerequisites**: The character must have a physical body and soul. None of its stats can be blank (-).

**Benefits**: 

- You have resistance to [possessed](10-conditions-types.md#possessed), and thus advantage on saves against a spirit entering their body, and taking control of their body.
- You can make ["observe"](05-skills.md#observe) rolls at a -5 penalty when asleep (instead of a -10 penalty).

**Special (drawbacks)**:

- The second soul is considered to be same level as the character's and counts against the limit of foreign souls for the sake of [losing SP dice due possession](10-conditions-types.md#possessed).
- When you fall unconscious for a reason other than poisoning or HP total falling to zero, you must succeed a CHA save against your INT based threshold, else you regain consciousness with the second soul in control of the body. The DM determines the desires and goals of this second soul. On short or long rests subsequent to this event the character only regains half of the resources they would normally.

**Limitations**: This "boon" is somewhat niche and has serious ramifications on how a character is played. It should therefore be treated with extreme care.

___
#### Tremor Sense I-VI

**Type**: (Natural/Supernatural, Class A)

**Description**: You gain the ability to determine the location of an entity based on vibrations transmitted through the ground or liquid you and the entity are both in contact with.

**Prerequisites**:

|Tremor Sense level|Range|MP/SP dice prerequisite|Other|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|15ft|5|-|
|II|30ft|11|Tremor Sense I|
|III|45ft|17|Tremor Sense II|
|IV|60ft|23|Tremor Sense III|
|V|90ft|29|Tremor Sense IV|
|VI|120ft|35|Tremor Sense V|

**Special**:

- "Tremor Sense" can be natural or supernatural.
- Beings can be detected by a character with tremor sense if they are in range and not wholly separated by air or vacuum. Thus tremor sense does not help one to detect flying entities.
- Beings detected by tremor sense normally do not benefit from concealment vis-a-vis the detecting character.
- "Tremor Sense" allows a character to localise an entity based on vibration, however, for the sake of targeted ranged attacks the detecting character still has disadvantage.
- It is still possible to gain concealment against tremor sense in environments with a lot of background vibrations, for example a site of heavy construction or industry, or a seismically active zone.

___
#### Truesight I-VI

**Type**: (Supernatural, Class S)

**Description**: You gain the ability to see through illusions and to see the true form of that which has been supernaturally transformed.

**Special**:

- Truesight is applied on top of of any other "sight", but does not apply to vision abilities ending with "sense" eg. "Tremor Sense"
- Truesight does not allow one to see through solid objects or natural/mundane disguises, nor does it defeat stealth, unless the stealthed entity is using an illusionary feature to hide itself. 

**Prerequisites**:

|Truesight level|Range|MP dice prerequisite|Other|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|30ft|15|-|
|II|60ft|18|Truesight I|
|III|90ft|24|Truesight II|
|IV|120ft|30|Truesight III|
|V|150ft|36|Truesight IV|
|VI|180ft|42|Truesight V|

___
#### Xenophonia I-XIII

**Type**: (Natural/Supernatural, Class A-C)

**Description**: Also known as "Speak to X". You are able to communicate vocally to entities of a given subtype *other than your own* in a way that the signals will be understood. Likewise you can understand their communication, vocal or otherwise, if you have the means to detect it.

**Prerequisite:** Xenophonia of various types can be taken in any order, but prerequisites must be obeyed. For example to take xenophonia(undead), a character must be at least level 6, or to take xenophonia(animals) a character must be level 2. On the other hand to take Xenophonia(Fey) a character must be at least level 6 and have at least one other xenophonia, though it can be *any* type, so for example a level 6 character with xenophonia(animal), or a level 7 character with xenophonia(elemental) can both take xenophonia(fey). 

|Entity sub-type|Level Prerequisite|Other|Nature of Ability
|-|-|-|-|
|Animal|1|-|Natural/Supernatural (chose)|
|Plant|3|Xenophonia I|Natural/Supernatural (chose)|
|Monster|3|Xenophonia I|Supernatural|
|Humanoid|6|Xenophonia I|Natural/Supernatural (chose)|
|Dragon|10|Xenophonia II|Supernatural|
||||
|Undead|3|-|Supernatural|
|Fiend|9|Xenophonia III|Supernatural|
||||
|Robot|6|-|Natural/Supernatural (chose)|
|Golem|8|Xenophonia I|Supernatural|
||||
|Elemental|4|-|Supernatural|
|Spirit|6|-|Supernatural|
|Fey|6|Xenophonia I|Supernatural|
||||
|Angel|12|Xenophonia III|Supernatural|

**Limitations**: A character can never gain xenophonia of their own original entity subtype. Thus a humanoid, or a humanoid that has become undead, can never gain "xenophonia: humanoid". Likewise, a spirit, even if it posses a mortal, would never be able to gain "xenophonia: spirits".

**Special**:

- Even if you can communicate through xenophonia with beings of other types using signals that they understand, the content of your communication may still be incomprehensible to them due to alien minds, incompatible conceptual frameworks or limited intellectual capacity. For example, the concept of death may be alien to certain spirits, while a plant may not have the ability to count, while a hedgehog might not know what a steam train is.
- Characters with "xenophonia" can never use the ability to understand "glitches" and "divines".
- A character may only take one type of "xenophonia" per level.


___
### Spellcasting

Spell casting abilities come in two flavour: Local and Global. Local spellcasting covers spells which take no longer than an hour to cast, have effects that wear off in a month of less and do not reach further than a mile from the point of casting. They are most useful in battle and situations where an immediate effect is needed. Global spellcasting covers everything else and is used in various applications, from near impenetrable barrier on holy sites, to enchantments that bring fertile harvests to whole kingdoms over the centuries.

The rules for use of spells in combat are found in ["Combat: Spells"](04-combat.md#spells). Other magic rules are found in ["Magic and Spellcasting"](07-magic-and-spellcasting.md). Spell lists are found in ["Spell List"](08-spell-list.md)

___
#### Aphonic Spell

**Type**: (Class B)

**Description**: Spend 1 MP dice to cast a spell without uttering the incantation.

**Declaration**: Declare "aphonic spell" before casting the spell.

**Prerequisite**: 6 MP dice total + the ability to cast spells.

**Special**: 

- Must be taken separately for each type of spellcasting.
- Can be combined with "still spell" and "lingering spell".
- This allows casting of spells with incantations when under the effects of "aphonia" or "inaudible".

(Technically this is a boon)

___
#### Forbidden Spell

**Type**: Supernatural (C-A)

**Description**: Learn 2 spells that are not covered by any ordinary type of spellcasting.

**Original State**: A character with spellcasting can only learn spells with descriptors associated with that spellcasting type (nature and elemental spellcasting), or only the allowed components (incantation and kinetic spellcasting).

**Action**: None. The spells are chosen on levelling up, when the ability is chosen.

**Prerequisite**: The character must have a level of spellcasting of one of the elemental [spellcasting types](#spellcasting-local) that is at least as high as the level of the spells chosen with this ability.

**Limitation**: 

- The spell cannot have a descriptor opposite to the "spellcasting type" used to obtain it.
- Many of these spells may cause a shift in character alignment or have negative mechanistic or narrative consequences. Usually these spells have the "profane" or "spirit" descriptors. This should be kept in mind.
- The spell cannot have a minimum MP dice cost of 8 or higher. For those, ["High Arcana](#high-arcana)" is used.

___
#### High Arcana

**Type**: Supernatural (S)

**Description**: Learn 1 spell with a minimum local casting cost of 8 or higher for which you meet the prerequisites.

**Original State**: A character with spellcasting VII can only learn spells of a minimum MP dice cost of 7 or lower.

**Action**: None. The spells are chosen on levelling up, when the ability is chosen.

**Prerequisite**:

- The character must have "[Spellcasting: Local VII](#spellcasting-local) of the appropriate category" or (["Spellcasting: Global VII"](#spellcasting-global) AND "Spellcasting: Local I" of the appropriate category)
- Their [character level / 2] (rounded up) is equal to, or higher than, the minimum MP dice cost of the spell. So for "Realm of Flame" (cost 10), the minimum level is 19. For ["Greater Domain"](08-spell-list.md#greater-domain) (cost 8), the minimum level is 15. See the table below.
- A character must know at least one spell of the previous MP dice cost level. So to learn "Greater Domain" (cost 8), a character must know at least one spell of a minimum MP dice cost of 7.
- Spells of minimum dice cost of 8-10 are generally learned with the ["High Arcana"](#high-arcana) ability.

|Minimum MP dice casting cost|Level Prerequisite|
|-|-|
|8|15|
|9|17|
|10|19|

___
#### Lingering Spell

**Type**: (Class A)

**Description**: Spend 1 MP dice to add the base duration of the spell to its total duration for non-global spell with a duration of at least one round.

**Declaration**: Declare "lingering spell" before casting the spell.

**Prerequisite**: 6 MP dice total + the ability to cast spells.

**Special**:

- Must be taken separately for each type of spellcasting.
- Can be combined with "still spell" and "aphonic spell".

___
#### Safe Cast

**Type**: (Class B)

**Description**: Your spellcasting no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.

+ This means that spells with kinetic components do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Limitations**: Entities with the "mage hunter" boon can still make attacks of opportunity against your spells UNLESS you also have the "mage hunter" boon.

**Prerequisites**:

- Proficiency with at least one weapon proficiency group.
- 4 SP dice and 7 MP dice total.
- At least one spellcasting ability.

**Warning**: This boon is best used together with the "mage hunter" boon.

___
#### Spellcasting: Local

There are several forms of spellcasting in this category, but they all have similar mechanics and have the same prerequisites. The casting types in this category are:

- Elemental: Air
- Elemental: Earth
- Elemental: Fire
- Elemental: Ice
- Incantation
- Kinetic
- Nature

**Special**:

- Each time a character wishes to learn the new category of local magic, they must take it as a separate ability.
- Each type of local magic also covers some global spells. As long a character has "Spellcasting: Global I" and the requisite level of local spellcasting of the type, they can cast global spells of that type and level.
- In order to get the next level of a type of local magic, a character must have the previous one. So if a character wishes to learn "Spellcasting: Nature III", they must have "Spellcasting: Nature II", which requires having "Spellcasting: Nature I".
- A spellcaster can never channel more than 1/3 of their MP dice total into a single "local" spell.
- A spellcaster can never cast a spell with a minimum local (or local equivalent) MP dice cost higher than half of their level rounded up. So a level 13 character cannot cast a spell with a minimum MP dice cost of 8, 9, or 10.
- Spells with a minimum local casting cost of more than 7 MP dice exist. A character can learn and cast these spells, if:
  - They have Spellcasting: Local VII of the appropriate category (eg Spellcasting: Local (Elemental: Fire) for ["Realm of Flame"](08-spell-list.md#realm-of-flame)).
  - Their [character level / 2] (rounded up) is equal to, or higher than, the minimum MP dice cost of the spell. So for "Realm of Flame" (cost 10), the minimum level is 19. For ["Greater Domain"](08-spell-list.md#greater-domain) (cost 8), the minimum level is 15. See the "Minimum levels for higher level spells" table below.
  - A character must know at least one spell of the previous MP dice cost level. So to learn "Greater Domain" (cost 8), a character must know at least one spell of a minimum MP dice cost of 7.
  - Spells of minimum dice cost of 8-10 are generally learned with the ["High Arcana"](#high-arcana) ability.

**Local Spellcasting table**:

|Ability level|MP dice casting cost|MP dice prerequisite|Level Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|1|3|1|
|II|2|6|3|
|III|3|9|5|
|IV|4|12|7|
|V|5|16|9|
|VI|6|20|11|
|VII|7+|24|13|

**Minimum levels for higher level spells**:

|Minimum MP dice casting cost|Level Prerequisite|
|-|-|
|8|15|
|9|17|
|10|19|

___
#### Spellcasting: Global

Global magic covers the casting of all global spells. In order to access and cast global spells of a certain type and level a character must have either of:

1. The requisite level in that type of local magic and 1 level of global magic.
2. The requisite level of global magic and 1 level in that type of local magic.

So for example, to cast global 7th level Nature magic, a character must have either "Spellcasting: Nature VII" and "Spellcasting: Global I", or "Spellcasting: Global VII" and "Spellcasting: Nature I".

**Casting time and cost**: Global spells take at least an hour to cast, but more often the casting time is measured in days or weeks. Thus the MP dice cost is measured in "dice per day". A global casting of a spell can either cost x2 or x4 the number of MP dice of the local spell.

**Special**: For spells of MP dice cost 8 and above, the same rules as for higher local spells apply. The only change is that the minimum level for using these spells is calculated in accordance to the theoretical local casting cost of the spell (even if it cannot be cast locally).

**Global Spellcasting table**:

|Ability level|MP dice casting cost per day of casting|MP dice prerequisite|Level Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|3|3|1|
|II|6|6|3|
|III|9|9|5|
|IV|12|12|7|
|V|15|16|9|
|VI|18|20|11|
|VII|21|24|13|

___
#### Spelldance I-IV

**Type**: Supernatural (C-A) 

**Description**: Mingle dance and spell to produce modifications to the spells cast. This ability mirrors "spellsong" (below).

**Action**: Declare "spelldance" when casting a spell that has a cast time of an "action" or "secondary action" and expend an extra 1 MP. This uses your "move action", although you may move up to half of its movement speed/distance during this time if it would otherwise be possible. Declare which modifications apply to the spell (see "effects" and "Spelldance table" below).

**Duration**: Similarly to "bard song", the dancer must use their "move action" on each subsequent turn to maintain the "spelldance" and its effect, if the spell has a duration. The dancer can continue a dance for a number of rounds equal to their CON score.

**Effect**: Spelldance allows the spellcaster to produce one of the following effects:

- Modify the shape of an area of affect spell slightly, including or excluding a number of 5ft squares equal to twice the level of the spelldance. For global spells this is a number of 100ft squares equal to twice the level of the spelldance.
- Modify the damage type of the spell within certain subgroups (see below).
- Obfuscate the spell if it has only kinetic components. In this case, make a ["perform"](05-skills.md#perform) roll. Any target observing the casting that does not succeed on an opposed ["Knowledge: Arcana"](05-skills.md#knowledge) roll does not recognise that a spell is being cast and cannot identify (although it can recognise that a spell has been cast from the effects after the fact). This is useful in situations where subtlety is required, and to obstruct counter-spelling.

**Damage Group Conversions**: For the sake of spelldance, damage is grouped by themes, thus conversion is possible between thematically similar damage types. All damage types within the group are mutually convertible by spelldance. On the other hand damage types *between* groups, or outside of them cannot be converted.

|Group Name|Damage Types|
|-|-|
|Strength|All physical|
|Poison|Poison, Necrotic, Cold|
|Warmth|Fire, Light, Lightning|
|Light|Light, Cold, Divine|
|Destruction|Necrotic, Entropic|

**Special**: Conversions to "divine" or "entropic" damage types increase the cost of the spell by 3 MP dice (instead of 1), and deal half of the damage to the caster as backlash for impinging on the domain of the gods.

**Limitations**:

- Only spells with kinetic components can be modified with spellsong.
- A character that is "restrained", "immobilised", or is otherwise unable to move cannot use "spelldance".

**Spelldance table**:

|Spelldance Level|Perform Ranks|Minimum Spell MP dice cost|5ft Squares Moved|Damage Groups Conversions|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|I|1|1|2|-|
|II|3|2|4|"Strength"|
|III|5|3|6|"Poison", "Warmth"|
|IV|7|4|8|"Light", "Destruction"|

___
#### Spellsong I-IV

**Type**: Supernatural (C-A) 

**Description**: Mingle song and spell to produce subtle modifications to the spells cast.

**Action**: Declare "spellsong" when casting a spell that has a cast time of an "action" or "secondary action" and expend an extra 1 MP. The spell will now cost a "full round action". Declare which condition to apply or to cure (see "Spellsong table" below).

**Duration**: As with "bard song", the singer must use a "secondary action" on each subsequent turn to maintain the spellsong and its effect. The signer can continue a song for a number of rounds equal to its CON score.

**Effect**: The targets of the spell must succeed an additional WIS save (at the start of its turn) or be affected by the declared condition or cured of it. An entity affected by spellsong, makes a WIS save at the start of its turn as usual to end the effect on itself.

ALTERNATIVELY, instead of picking a condition, the singer may elect to restore [base]d4 SP and MP to a single entity that can hear the song.

ALTERNATIVELY, instead of picking a condition, if the spell has ONLY incantation components, make a ["perform"](05-skills.md#perform) roll. Any target observing the casting that does not succeed on an opposed ["Knowledge: Arcana"](05-skills.md#knowledge) roll does not recognise that a spell is being cast and cannot identify (although it can recognise that a spell has been cast from the effects after the fact). This is useful in situations where subtlety is required, and to obstruct counter-spelling.

**Limitations**:

- Only spells with incantation components can be modified with spellsong.
- A character that is "aphonic", "silenced", or otherwise cannot produce sound cannot use "spellsong".
- A character that is "deafened" or otherwise cannot perceive sound cannot be affected by "spellsong".

**Spellsong table**: It should be noted that conditions from the "conditions" column can be applied or cured with spellsong, but conditions from the "cured only" column can be cured, but not applied, at that level of spellsong.

|Spellsong Level|Perform Ranks|Minimum Spell MP dice cost|[Conditions](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail)|Cured Only
|-|-|-|-|-|
|I|1|1|"Deafened", "Aphonic"|"Frightened"|
|II|3|2|"Charmed", "Frightened"|"Incapacitated"|
|III|5|3|"Bleeding", "Catatonic"|"Dominated"|
|IV|7|4|"Stunned", "Immobilised"|"Paralysed", "Possessed"|

___
#### Still Spell

**Type**: (Class A)

**Description**: Spend 1 MP dice to cast a spell without kinetic components.

**Declaration**: Declare "still spell" before casting the spell.

**Prerequisite**: 6 MP dice total + the ability to cast spells.

**Special**:

- This allows spellcasting when "immobilised" or "restrained".

___
#### Swift Spell

**Type**: (Class A)

**Description**: Spend 2 MP dice to reduce the casting time of a spell from "main action" to "secondary action", or from "full round action" to "main actin".

**Declaration**: Declare "swift spell" before casting the spell.

**Limitation**: If the character casts a "swift spell" in the same turn as casting another spell, and both spells have an MP dice cost of 2 or higher, the character takes 2 points of HP damage.

**Prerequisite**:

- 6 MP dice total
- The ability to cast spells.
- +13 DEX or +13 INT.

**Special**:

- Must be taken separately for each type of spellcasting.

- 4 SP dice and 7 MP dice total.
- At least one spellcasting ability.
