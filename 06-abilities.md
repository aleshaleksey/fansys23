**Abilities** are special actions that a character can take outside of the core actions available to all characters (covered in "Combat", "Movement and Exploration", and "Skills"). Abilities are often more potent than the core actions, but these also come at a cost of consuming SP dice and MP dice, so use them with care. Importantly, magic is covered at the end of this chapter.

**Boons** are traits that enhance a character beyond what it would otherwise be. For example, a boon might grant resistance to "bludgeoning" damage, or allow a character to move faster, or breath under water, or attack more than once during a "main action".

The line between "boons" and "abilities" is a fine one, but in general "abilities" are something that is actively used, (eg, "I use elemental touch", "I use far throw"), while a boon is something that is used passively (eg "I have skirmisher so I move behind the enemy where I am flanking and you don't get an attack of opportunity."). 

Each category is split up into "combat", "exploration" or "general". The categories are not perfect but they cover most bases relatively well.

## Prerequisites

Some abilities and boons have prerequisites. These are there to balance the game, but also to make sense: How does one learn an advanced ability when one does not know the basics? A character that loses a prerequisite for an ability or boon cannot use the ability or boon until that prerequisite is restored.

The most common prerequisites are a minimum [Base], a minimum level, or a minimum total of SP or MP dice.

## Max dice per level

For combat and general abilities the number of dice used per single ability is equal to half the character's level rounded up. For global magic there is no limit.

## Rating

All abilities and boons are rated "C" through "S" class. "C" is considered 'weakest', while 'S' is considered strongest (although this does not necessarily determine general usefulness). This is used mostly for the creation of templates, but also as a guideline for determining prerequisites.

## Abilities

### Declaration

Unless otherwise stated an ability must be declared and any cost paid upfront before any rolls are made.

### Combat Abilities (Natural)
___
#### Assassinate I-V

**Description**: A character can take advantage of moments of weakness to make a strike that bypasses a target's defences. Damage from this deadly ability is dealt directly to the target's HP.

**Action:** Declare "assassinate" and make the attack.

**Offence**:
- Exertion: Yes.
- Range: Weapon range, but no more than 30ft + 5ft/[assassinate level]
- Duration: Instantaneous.
- Action: "main action".
- Target: 1.
- Attack: Weapon attack.
- Damage: Weapon damage (directly vs HP).
- Dice: None.

**Prerequisites**:
- Precision attack III.
- Character level of at least [Assassinate level] x 4

**Special**:
- You can only make one attack as your main action when using "assassinate".
- The target must affected by at least one of the conditions that your assassinate level qualifies you for. For example at "Assassinate I", it must be "immobilised", at "Assassinate 3" it must be "immobilised", or "surprised" or "stunned".
- Assassinate automatically fails if the target has heavy, or total, concealment, or if it is "invisible" to you. This means that, for example, entities without low light vision, or other special sight, cannot use "assassinate" with ranged attacks in low light conditions or darkness.
- If "assassinate" is used with a ranged attack, it must be within the first range increment of the weapon. 
- Since it uses a "main action" it cannot be used as a "reaction".
- You cannot use "assassinate" when in conjunction wit "Berserk" and similar abilities.

|Assassinate level|Exploited Condition|Minimum Level|
|-|-|-|
|I|Immobilised|4 (5)|
|II|+Surprised (or unaware)|8|
|III|+Stunned|12|
|IV|+Incapacitated|16|
|V|+Restrained/Blinded|20|

___
#### Berserk I-V

**Description**: You enter a trance of violence, enhancing combat prowess at the cost of stressing the physical form past its limits.

**Action**: Declare berserk as a "secondary action".

**Effect**: A Berserk character can remain in the trance for [SP dice count] rounds. However, if the character does not take damage or attack from the the end of the start of their turn one round to their next turn, the trance ends. The character gains a number of SP equal to their SP Dice maximum. In addition the character has a bonus to walk, climb, swim and fly speed, weapon damage, and may have advantage on attacks.

**Special**:
- Berserk does not have an SP dice cost. However, when the berserker trance is over, you lose a number of HP equal to the level of the Berserk ability (so if you have "Berserk I" you lose 1HP). In addition, the SP gained at the start of berserker trance is lost. If this takes the character into negative SP, it then loses a number of HP equal to half its level rounded down (this is in addition to the standard HP loss).
- While "berserk", a character may not use Int based skills and has disadvantage on all Wis and Cha based skills while Berserk. It has disadvantage on "Tinker" rolls.
- While "berserk", a character cannot cast spells with a kinetic component and must roll a 1d6 when trying to cast spells with an incantation, losing the spell on a 3 or lower.
- While "berserk", a character may not use abilities such as "precision attack".

**Berserk Table**:

|Berserk level|SP dice prerequisite|Speed boost|Attack|Damage|Extra
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|I|3|-|normal|2|-|
|II|9|5|normal|3|Advantage vs "frightened"|
|III|18|10|normal|4|Advantage vs "grappled" & "restrained"|
|IV|30|15|advantage|5|Advantage vs vs "Charmed"|
|V|45|20|advantage|6|Advantage vs "stunned" & "incapacitated"|

**Original state**: A single melee attack can only strike one target.

___
#### Combined Manoeuvre I-V

**Description**: Combine two or more different "basic combat manoeuvre"s in one attack.

**Cost**: This is an exerting activity. For each manoeuvre combined one SP dice is expended.

|Number of Manoeuvres combined|SP dice cost|
|-|-|
|2|1|
|3|2|
|4|3|
|5|4|
|6|5|

**Prerequisites**: For every extra manoeuvre combined this ability must be taken again

|Number of Manoeuvres combined|SP dice total|Ability name|
|-|-|-|
|2|6|Combined Manoeuvre I|
|3|12|Combined Manoeuvre II|
|4|20|Combined Manoeuvre III|
|5|30|Combined Manoeuvre IV|
|6|42|Combined Manoeuvre V|

___
#### Counterstrike

**Description**: Gain an attack of opportunity against an attacker striking you with any melee attack.

**Prerequisite**: 6 SP dice.

**Original state**: In melee, only attacks with weapons the attacker is not proficient with provoke attacks of opportunity.

____
#### Debilitating Strike

**Action**:
1. Declare the ability and make the attack.
2. If you hit, expend the SP dice, target tries to save against your NAP + [Con] at the start of its turn.
3. On a fail, the target is affected until the end of its next turn.

|"Aphonia"|1|3|Aphonic Strike|
|"Blinded"|1|7|Blinding Strike|

___
#### Deflect Missile

**Type**: (Class B)

**Description**: Use 1 SP to use ["parry"](#parry) against ranged weapons attacks.

**Action**: When you use parry to deflect a ranged weapon attack, you may declare "Deflect Missile". Every time you do so, you must use 1 SP. The effect is as follows:
- If a ranged weapon attack would hit anyway, despite being parried, the *physical* damage is reduced by the roll of your [melee attack damage] + [NAP]. Thus if you hold a greatsword, and your melee damage is 2d6+4 and your NAP is 5, then the damage of that ranged attack is reduced by 2d6+9.
- If you fail a DEX save to evade a natural projectile (eg rockfall, or an arrow trap) when your declaration of parry is in effect, you can chose to deflect it, with the same effect as if you were deflecting a ranged weapon attack.

**Original state**: If the roll for a ranged attack exceeds your HiT, it hits and can do damage.

___
#### Great Strike

**Description**: Sacrifice precision for power when making melee attacks. (Swing like a helicopter).

**Action**: When making an attack with a melee weapon that is governed by STR, take a penalty up to your [Nat] to your attack roll and take the same number as a bonus to your damage if you hit. If the weapon is a two-handed "[heavy weapon](11-weapons-armour.md#weapon-properties)", the bonus to damage is doubled.

___
#### Greater Manoeuvre I-V

|3|6|Greater Manoeuvre I|
|4|12|Greater Manoeuvre II|
|5|20|Greater Manoeuvre III|
|6|30|Greater Manoeuvre IV|
|7|42|Greater Manoeuvre V|

___
#### Spirit Strike

**Type**: (Class A)

**Description**: Spend 1 MP dice to deal "supernatural" damage with a "natural" weapon attack.

**Limitation**: This must be an attack as defined in "[Basic Martial Manoeuvres](04-combat.md#basic-martial-manoeuvres)". It cannot be used in combination with abilities (other than "Multi-attack").
- OPTIONAL: If playing with alignment rules, a character who gains "Spirit Strike" should be spiritually aligned, and cannot use this ability if they lose this alignment.

**Prerequisites**: 12 MP dice total and 18 SP dice total.

___
### General Abilities (Supernatural)

#### Aphonic Spell

**Type**: (Class B)

**Description**: Spend 1 MP dice to cast a spell without uttering the incantation.

**Declaration**: Declare "aphonic spell" before casting the spell.

**Prerequisite**: 6 MP dice total + the ability to cast spells.

**Special**: 
- Must be taken separately for each time of spellcasting.
- Can be combined with "still spell" and "lingering spell".
- This allows casting of spells with incantations when under the effects of "aphonia" or "inaudible".

___
#### Bind Beast I-X

**Type**: A Class (I-V), S Class (VI-X).

**Description**: Bind an "animal" or "monster" to accompany and serve you. Mystics often use bound monsters as guardians.

**Action:**
- Exertion: Yes.
- Range: 30ft.
- Duration: Instantaneous.
- Action: 1 hour ritual.
- Target: A single "animal" or "monster" which must remain within 30ft of you for the duration of the ritual.
- Attack: None
- Damage: None
- Cost: 1 MP dice per level of beast.

**Benefits**: A bound beast may not disobey you and acts as a loyal servant, this does not mean, however that it necessarily likes it.
- A bound beast understands your commands and can be commanded in and out of battle with a "communicate" action. No "creature handling" check is required.
- Such a beast can be used for combat, scouting, guarding and other menial tasks within its capability.

**Limitations**:
- You must find a suitable beast and keep it still for long enough to bind it. It can attempt a Cha save vs your [SAP + [Cha]] to not be bound. You cannot attempt to bind the same beast for a month if it succeeds. If it succeeds three times, you can never bind it.
- If a beast has a higher level than your "Bind Beast" limit, you cannot bind it.
- If you do something, or order the beast to do something that would normally make it a "nemesis" (see "[Skills: Persuade](05-skills.md#persuade)"), it gets a Cha save vs your [SAP + [Cha]] at advantage to break the binding.
- You can never have more than one bound beast at a time.
- You must sacrifice 1HP of your own per 2 levels of "bind beast" to the beast every day to keep it bound (min 1). Sacrificing another's HP transfers the beast to their control for the day: Every day this is done the beast gets a Cha save vs the temporary master's [SAP + [Cha]] to break free.

**Rules**:
- If the beast's attack, damage dice, HP, SP or MP are greater than the values displayed on the table, they are reduced to that value.
- If the beast's attack, damage dice, HP, SP or MP are lower than 3/4 of the values displayed on the table, they are increased to 3/4 of the value.
- If its movement modalities are too high, it looses them until your "Bind Beast" level reaches a point where it is high enough. If the beast does not have these modalities, it does NOT gain them.
- The beast retains its HiT and uses your base save bonuses.
- The beast loses all abilities that exceed the max permitted class.
- The beast may serve as a mount if it can carry you.

**Prerequisite**: You must have at least one level of "global" or "incantation" or "nature" magic to gain this ability.

___
#### Bind Familiar I-IV

**Description**: Bind a minor spirit into a tiny animal to serve you. Spellcasters often use familiars for the most mundane and ridiculous of tasks.

**Action:**
- Exertion: Yes.
- Range: Your reach (usually 5ft).
- Duration: Instantaneous.
- Action: 1 hour ritual.
- Target: A single tiny animal that must remain within arm's reach for the whole duration of the ritual.
- Attack: None
- Damage: None
- Cost: 3 MP dice

**Benefits**: A familiar allows a spellcaster several benefits:
- A familiar can give advise (although it is often bad advise!).
- A familiar gives a "supernatural" bonus equal to the "Bind Familiar" level (must be chosen when the familiar is first bound) when the familiar is within 10ft of the binder, to one of the following:
  - "spellworking" rolls when working with global spells and to your threshold for global spells 
  - "concentration" saves to maintain spells.
  - "Knowledge:Arcana" rolls.
- A familiar can deliver spells and messages.
- A familiar can scout.
- A familiar (at higher levels) can also use "basic martial manoeuvres".

**Limitations**: A familiar has certain limitations.
- A familiar's vessel must be an animal of size "tiny" or "small".
- If a familiar's vessel is killed, it cannot be given a new vessel till the next day.
- A character can ONLY have one familiar.

**Rules**:
- A familiar has an intelligence of 5 + [Bind Familiar level] x 2.
- A familiar has HP, MP, and SP dependant on the "Bind Familiar" level.
- A familiar retains the HiT of its base creature but uses your saves, has resistance to damage based on the spellcasting that was used as a prerequisite to bind it.
- A familiar has an empathic link with its binder to a distance based on the "Bind familiar" level.

**Prerequisites**: To bind a familiar the entity must have at least one "spellcasting" ability.

**Familiar tables**:

|Ability Level|MP dice minimum|Max Vessel Level|HP|SP|MP|Int|Link range|Can Attack|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|I|3|1|3|3|3|7|120ft|No|

___
#### Lingering Spell

**Type**: (Class A)

**Description**: Spend 1 MP dice to add the base duration of the spell to its total duration for non-global spell with a duration of at least one round.

**Declaration**: Declare "lingering spell" before casting the spell.

**Prerequisite**: 6 MP dice total + the ability to cast spells.

**Special**:
- Must be taken separately for each time of spellcasting.
- Can be combined with "still spell" and "aphonic spell".

___
#### Spelldance I-IV

**Type**: Supernatural (C-A) 

**Description**: Mingle dance and spell to produce modifications to the spells cast. This ability mirrors "spellsong" (below).

**Action**: Declare "spelldance" when casting a spell that has a cast time of an "action" or "secondary action" and expend an extra 1 MP. This uses your "move action", although you may move up to half of its movement speed/distance during this time if it is otherwise possible. Declare which modifications apply to the spell (see "effects" and "Spellsong table" below).

**Duration**: Similarly to "bard song", the dancer must use their "move action" on each subsequent turn to maintain the "spelldance" and its effect, if the spell has a duration. The signer can continue a song for a number of rounds equal to its Con score.

**Effect**: Spelldance allows the spellcaster to produce one of the following effects:
- Modify the shape of an area of affect spell slightly, including or excluding a number of 5ft squares equal to twice the level of the spelldance. For global spells this is a number of 200ft squares equal to twice the level of the spelldance.
- Modify the damage type of the spell within certain subgroups (see below).
- Obfuscate the spell if it has only kinetic components. In this case, make a ["perform"](05-skills.md#perform) roll. Any target observing the casting that does not succeed on an opposed ["Knowledge: Arcana"](05-skills.md#knowledge) roll does not recognise that a spell is being cast and cannot identify (although it can recognise that a spell has been cast from the effects after the fact). This is useful in situations where subtlety is required, and to obstruct counter-spelling.

**Damage Group Conversions**: For the sake of spelldance, damage is grouped by themes, thus conversion is possible between thematically similar damage types. All damage types within the group ar mutually convertible by spelldance. On the other hand damage types *between* groups, or outside of them cannot be converted.

|Group Name|Damage Types|
|-|-|
|Strength|All physical|
|Poison|Poison, Necrotic, Cold|
|Warmth|Fire, Light, Lightning|
|Light|Light, Cold, Divine|
|Destruction|Necrotic, Atrophic|

**Special**: Conversions to "divine" or "atrophic" damage types increase the cost of the spell by 3 MP dice (instead of 1), and deal half of the damage to the caster as backlash for impinging on the domain of the gods.

**Limitations**:
- Only spells with kinetic components can be modified with spellsong.
- A character that is "restrained", "immobilised", or is otherwise unable to move cannot use "spelldance".

**Spelldance table**:
|Spelldance Level|Perform Ranks|Minimum Spell MP dice cost|5ft Squares Moved|Damage Groups Conversions|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|I|1|1|2|-|
|II|3|2|4|"Strength"|
|III|5|3|6|"Poison", "Warmth"|
|IV|7|4|8|"Light", "Destruction"|

___
#### Spellsong I-IV

**Type**: Supernatural (C-A) 

**Description**: Mingle song and spell to produce subtle modifications to the spells cast.

**Action**: Declare "spellsong" when casting a spell that has a cast time of an "action" or "secondary action" and expend an extra 1 MP. The spell will now cost a "full round action". Declare which condition to apply or to cure (see "Spellsong table" below).

**Duration**: As with "bard song", the singer must use a "secondary action" on each subsequent turn to maintain the spellsong and its effect. The signer can continue a song for a number of rounds equal to its Con score.

**Effect**: The targets of the spell must succeed an additional Wis save (at the start of its turn) or be affected by the declared condition or cured of it. An entity affected by spellsong, makes a Wis save at the start of its turn as usual to end the effect on itself.

ALTERNATIVELY, instead of picking a condition, if the spell has ONLY incantation components, make a ["perform"](05-skills.md#perform) roll. Any target observing the casting that does not succeed on an opposed ["Knowledge: Arcana"](05-skills.md#knowledge) roll does not recognise that a spell is being cast and cannot identify (although it can recognise that a spell has been cast from the effects after the fact). This is useful in situations where subtlety is required, and to obstruct counter-spelling.

**Limitations**:
- Only spells with incantation components can be modified with spellsong.
- A character that is "aphonic", "silenced", or otherwise cannot produce sound cannot use "spellsong".
- A character that is "deafened" or otherwise cannot perceive sound cannot be affected by "spellsong".

**Spellsong table**: It should be noted that conditions from the "conditions" column can be applied or cured with spellsong, but conditions from the "cured only" column can be cured, but not applied, at that level of spellsong.
|Spellsong Level|Perform Ranks|Minimum Spell MP dice cost|[Conditions](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail)|Cured Only
|-|-|-|-|-|
|I|1|1|"Deafened", "Aphonic"|"Frightened"|
|II|3|2|"Charmed", "Frightened"|"Catatonic"|
|III|5|3|"Bleeding", "Catatonic"|"Incapacitated"|
|IV|7|4|"Incapacitated", "Immobilised"|"Paralysed"|

___
#### Still Spell

**Type**: (Class A)

**Description**: Spend 1 MP dice to cast a spell without kinetic components.

**Declaration**: Declare "still spell" before casting the spell.

**Prerequisite**: 6 MP dice total + the ability to cast spells.

**Special**:
- Must be taken separately for each time of spellcasting.
- Can be combined with "aphonic spell", "lingering spell" and "swift spell".
- This allows spellcasting when "immobilised" or "restrained".

___
#### Swift Spell

**Type**: (Class A)

**Description**: Spend 2 MP dice to reduce the casting time of a spell from "main action" to "secondary action", or from "full round action" to "main actin".

**Prerequisite**:
- 6 MP dice total
- The ability to cast spells.
- +13 DEX or +13 INT.

**Special**:
- Must be taken separately for each time of spellcasting.
- Can be combined with "still spell", "lingering spell", and "aphonic spell".

___
### Spellcasting

Spell casting abilities come in two flavour: Local and Global. Local spellcasting covers spells which take no longer than an hour to cast, have effects that wear off in a month of less and do not reach further than a mile from the point of casting. They are most useful in battle and situations where an immediate effect is needed. Global spellcasting covers everything else and is used in various applications, from near impenetrable barrier on holy sites, to enchantments that bring fertile harvests to whole kingdoms over the centuries.

The rules for use of spells in combat are found in "[Combat: Spells](04-combat.md#spells)".

Other magic rules, including spell lists are found in "[Spells](07-spells.md)"

___
#### Forbidden Spell

**Type**: Supernatural (C-A)

**Description**: Learn 2 spells that are not covered by any ordinary type of spellcasting.

**Original State**: A character with spellcasting can only learn spells with descriptors associated with that spellcasting type (nature and elemental spellcasting), or only the allowed components (incantation and kinetic spellcasting).

**Action**: None. The spells are chosen on levelling up, when the ability is chosen.

**Prerequisite**: The character must have a level of spellcasting of one of the elemental [spellcasting types](#spellcasting-local) that is at least as high as the level of the spells chosen with this ability.

**Limitation**: 
- The spell cannot have a descriptor opposite to the "spellcasting type" used to obtain it.
- Many of these spells may cause a shift in character alignment or have negative mechanistic or narrative consequences. Usually these spells have the "profane" or "spirit" descriptors. This should be kept in mind.
- The spell cannot have a minimum MP dice cost of 8 or higher. For those, ["High Arcana](#high-arcana)" is used.

___
#### High Arcana

**Type**: Supernatural (S)

**Description**: Learn 1 spell with a minimum local casting cost of 8 or higher for which you meet the prerequisites.

**Original State**: A character with spellcasting VII can only learn spells of a minimum MP dice cost of 7 or lower.

**Action**: None. The spells are chosen on levelling up, when the ability is chosen.

**Prerequisite**:
- The character must have "[Spellcasting: Local VII](#spellcasting-local) of the appropriate category" or ("[Spellcasting: Global VII](#spellcasting-global)" AND "Spellcasting: Local I" of the appropriate category)
- Their [character level / 2] (rounded up) is equal to, or higher than, the minimum MP dice cost of the spell. So for "Realm of Flame" (cost 10), the minimum level is 19. For "[Greater Domain](08-spell-list.md#greater-domain)" (cost 8), the minimum level is 15. See the table below.
- A character must know at least one spell of the previous MP dice cost level. So to learn "Greater Domain" (cost 8), a character must know at least one spell of a minimum MP dice cost of 7.
- Spells of minimum dice cost of 8-10 are generally learned with the "[High Arcana](#high-arcana)" ability.

|Minimum MP dice casting cost|Level Prerequisite|
|-|-|
|8|15|
|9|17|
|10|19|

___
#### Spellcasting: Local

There are several forms of spellcasting in this category, but they all have similar mechanics and have the same prerequisites. The casting types in this category are:

- Elemental: Air
- Elemental: Earth
- Elemental: Fire
- Elemental: Ice
- Incantation
- Kinetic
- Nature

**Special**:
- Each time a character wishes to learn the new category of local magic, they must take it as a separate ability.
- Each type of local magic also covers some global spells. As long a character has "Spellcasting: Global I" and the requisite level of local spellcasting of the type, they can cast global spells of that type and level.
- In order to get the next level of a type of local magic, a character must have the previous one. So if a character wishes to learn "Spellcasting: Nature III", they must have "Spellcasting: Nature II", which requires having "Spellcasting: Nature I".
- A spellcaster can never channel more than 1/3 of their MP dice total into a single "local" spell.
- A spellcaster can never cast a spell with a minimum local (or local equivalent) MP dice cost higher than half of their level rounded up. So a level 13 character cannot cast a spell with a minimum MP dice cost of 8, 9, or 10.
- Spells with a minimum local casting cost of more than 7 MP dice exist. A character can learn and cast these spells, if:
  - They have Spellcasting: Local VII of the appropriate category (eg Spellcasting: Local (Elemental: Fire) for "[Realm of Flame](08-spell-list.md#realm-of-flame)").
  - Their [character level / 2] (rounded up) is equal to, or higher than, the minimum MP dice cost of the spell. So for "Realm of Flame" (cost 10), the minimum level is 19. For "[Greater Domain](08-spell-list.md#greater-domain)" (cost 8), the minimum level is 15. See the "Minimum levels for higher level spells" table below.
  - A character must know at least one spell of the previous MP dice cost level. So to learn "Greater Domain" (cost 8), a character must know at least one spell of a minimum MP dice cost of 7.
  - Spells of minimum dice cost of 8-10 are generally learned with the "[High Arcana](#high-arcana)" ability.

**Local Spellcasting table**:

|Ability level|MP dice casting cost|MP dice prerequisite|Level Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|1|3|1|
|II|2|6|3|
|III|3|9|5|
|IV|4|12|7|
|V|5|16|9|
|VI|6|20|11|
|VII|7+|24|13|

**Minimum levels for higher level spells**:

|Minimum MP dice casting cost|Level Prerequisite|

|8|15|
|9|17|
|10|19|

___
#### Spellcasting: Global

Global magic covers the casting of all global spells. In order to access and cast global spells of a certain type and level a character must have either of:

1. The requisite level in that type of local magic and 1 level of global magic.
2. The requisite level of global magic and 1 level in that type of local magic.

So for example, to cast global 7th level Nature magic, a character must have either "Spellcasting: Nature VII" and "Spellcasting: Global I", or "Spellcasting: Global VII" and "Spellcasting: Nature I".

**Casting time and cost**: Global spells take at least an hour to cast, but more often the casting time is measured in days or weeks. Thus the MP dice cost is measured in "dice per day".

**Special**: For spells of MP dice cost 8 and above, the same rules as for higher local spells apply. The only change is that the minimum level for using these spells is calculated as [Global casting MP dice cost / 2].

**Global Spellcasting table**:

|Ability level|MP dice casting cost per day of casting|MP dice prerequisite|Level Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|3|3|1|
|II|6|6|3|
|III|9|9|5|
|IV|12|12|7|
|V|15|16|9|
|VI|18|20|11|
|VII|21|24|13|

### Combat Boons (Supernatural)

___
#### Arcane Interception

**Type**: (Supernatural, A)

**Description**: You can use the "interception" manoeuvre to redirect supernatural attacks that require a saving throw at yourself.

**Original state**: "Intercept" manoeuvre can only be used to intercept attacks that require an attack roll (targeted attacks).

**Action**: As a "main action":
- Declare a target to protect. You must be within reach of your mark, or the direct line between the attacker and target must pass through your square.
- When a supernatural attack that requires a saving throw is made against your mark before the start of your next turn, it is automatically redirected at you, and you make the save and/or potentially suffer the effect.

As a "reaction": This works in the same way as the "main action" mode, however you can only defend your target against one such attack.

**Limitation**: You can only protect a single target against area of effect attacks, or attacks that would affect multiple targets.

**Prerequisites**:
- Proficiency with the "interception" manoeuvre.
- At least one rank in any of: "Knowledge: Arcana", "Knowledge: Religion", or "Spellworking".
- At least one level of any "local" [spellcasting](#spellcasting-local) ability.

**Warning**: This is a bit niche and build dependant. It is here as homage to the belief that these abilities can be either "natural" or "supernatural". It does not necessarily improve the build.

___

___
#### Low-light Vision

**Type**: (Natural/Supernatural, Class B)

**Description**: You can see in low light conditions (eg a starry night) as if it was daytime. However, you cannot see in pitch black (a sealed cave or the oceanic abyss). A character with low-light vision treats dim light (such as the illumination between the "bright" and "dim" radius of a torch) as bright light, it will then treat a radius twice that as dim light. Thus if the "dim light" radius of a torch ends within 40ft, a character with "low-light vision" would see within 40ft of the torch as if it were in bright light, and between 40-80ft as if it were in dim light.

**Prerequisites**: 15 MP dice.

**Special**: "Low-light vision" is a "supernatural" boon when taken with level points, but can be natural as part of a template or monster block.

The "medium load" penalties are applied as normal (and at the same weight as the new "light load" limit).

**Prerequisite**: Mighty I + 15 STR + 15 CON.

___
#### Quick Mount

**Description**: You mount as a "secondary action" and quick-mount as a "non-action". "Dismount" becomes a "minor interaction". Furthermore you can always "take care" when mounting (but not quick-mounting). The thresholds are not affected.

- A character can take this boon once per point of base it has. Each time it must apply to a different type of terrain.
- When a character gains a point of base, they can change a terrain mastery for a different terrain. This reflects the gradual gain and loss of knowledge and skill with time.

**Prerequisite**: 1 ranks in "Track".

|VI|120ft|35|Tremor Sense V|

**Special**:
- "Tremor Sense" can be natural or supernatural.
- "Tremor Sense" allows you to localise an entity, however, for the sake of targeted ranged attacks you still have disadvantage.
- "Tremor Sense" bypasses conventional concealment, making eg. hiding behind a crate useless, but is almost useless against flying entities or those with no path shorter than the ability's range that can be drawn through solid/liquid medium.

___
#### Truesight I-V

**Type**: (Supernatural, Class S)

**Description**: You gain the ability to see through illusions and to see the true form of that which has been supernaturally transformed.

**Special**:
- Truesight is applied on top of of any other "sight", but does not apply to vision abilities ending with "sense" eg. "Tremor Sense"
- Truesight does not allow one to see through solid objects or natural/mundane disguises, nor does it defeat stealth, unless the stealthed entity is using an illusionary feature to hide itself. 

**Prerequisites**:
|Life Sense level|Range|MP dice prerequisite|Other|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|30ft|15|-|
|II|60ft|18|Truesight I|

#### Xenophonia I-XIII

**Type**: (Natural/Supernatural, Class A-C)

**Description**: Also known as "Speak to X". You are able to communicate vocally to entities of a given subtype *other than your own* in a way that the signals will be understood. Likewise you can understand their communication, vocal or otherwise, if you have the means to detect it.

**Prerequisite:** Xenophonia of various types can be taken in any order, but prerequisites must be obeyed. For example to take xenophonia(undead), a character must be at least level 6, or to take xenophonia(animals) a character must be level 2. On the other hand to take Xenophonia(Fey) a character must be at least level 6 and have at least one other xenophonia, though it can be *any* type, so for example a level 6 character with xenophonia(animal), or a level 7 character with xenophonia(elemental) can both take xenophonia(fey). 

|Entity sub-type|Level Prerequisite|Other|Nature of Ability
|-|-|-|-|
|Animal|4|-|Natural/Supernatural (chose)|
|Plant|4|Xenophonia I|Natural/Supernatural (chose)|
|Undead|6|-|Supernatural|
|Monster|6|Xenophonia I|Supernatural|
|Humanoid|6|Xenophonia I|Natural/Supernatural (chose)|
|Robot|6|-|Natural/Supernatural (chose)|
|Fey|6|Xenophonia I|Supernatural|
|Elemental|6|-|Supernatural|
|Golem|8|Xenophonia I|Supernatural|
|Spirit|8|-|Supernatural|
|Dragon|10|Xenophonia II|Supernatural|
|Angel|12|Xenophonia III|Supernatural|
|Fiend|12|Xenophonia III|Supernatural|

**Special**
- Even if you can communicate through xenophonia with beings of other types using signals that they understand, the content of your communication may still be incomprehensible to them due to alien minds, incompatible conceptual frameworks or limited intellectual capacity. For example, the concept of death may be alien to certain spirits, while a plant may not have the ability to count, while a hedgehog might not know what a steam train is.
- Characters with "xenophonia" can never use the ability to understand "glitches" and "divines".
- A character may only take one type of "xenophonia" per level.
