|Duration|12 minutes|
|Components|Incantation, Kinetic|-1
|Focus|A talisman made of material from a hidden valley, or a pouch of nettle leaves|
|Save|WIS/INT|

**Description**: The target of the spell may attempt to go unnoticed in areas watched by various scrying magics or within wards such as "[Warded Ground](#warded-ground)". An unwilling target may negate the effect with a successful WIS save.

In order to do so, the target of "Fade" must succeed an INT save vs the Threshold of the one who cast the detection magic the first time that the magic would normally detect it. On a successful save, the detection magic does not detect the target or any objects on its person (within its carrying capacity) or supernatural effects that are affecting it. Repeated saves are not necessary.

If the detection magic is cast at a higher MP dice cost level (higher MP dice cost of local casting) than "Fade", or if detection is by a supernatural ability of "class B" or higher, then the target of "Fade" makes its save at disadvantage.

**Upcast**: Firstly, the spell lasts for an extra 12 minutes for every extra MP die above 1 used to cast it. Secondly the spell becomes effective against spells that were cast at the same "spell level" (disadvantage no longer applies).

Any entity that starts its turn in the area that does not succeed a Str Save is blown back 10ft and lands prone.

**Upcast**: Increase the radius of the cone by 5ft for each extra MP die above 1.

|Casting time|"1 main action" (1 hour + 20min per extra 4MP dice)|
|Range|close|-1
|Duration|1 hour (1 week)|+6
|Components|kinetic, incantation|-1
|Focus|A flower associated with daylight, or a crystal|
|Damage|1d4+[SUP] light|
|Concentration|local|

**Description**: The caster summons a mote of light and binds it to a valid target, giving it the "glowing" condition. An unwilling target may break the effect with a successful Cha save, thus ending the spell. The mote sheds bright light in 40ft and dim light in total radius of 100ft.

Incorporeal ["undead"](10-conditions-types.md#profane) and ["fiends"](10-conditions-types.md#profane) have disadvantage on attacks and saves within the radius of the bright light.

As a secondary action the caster may dismiss the flare, causing 1d4+[SUP] damage to a single target within 5ft and hence ending the spell.

**Upcast**: For each extra MP die above 1 the spell may last for an extra hour or the radius of bright and dim light increase each by 10ft.

 ### Lesser Illusory Self
|Name|Lesser Illusory Self [Air, Illusion, Kinetic, Spring, Water, Winter]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|1 (2)|
|Target(s)|1 entity|
|Casting time|1 main action (1 hour)|
|Range|close|-1
|Duration|1 hour (1 week)|(5)
|Components|kinetic|
|Focus|A small mirror|-1(4)
|Limitation|This spell only produces acoustic and visual effects. It is defeated by touch, taste and smell|-2(2)
|Limitation|This spell is defeated by "true sight", "tremor sense" or "blind-sight"|-4(-2)
|Save|CHA/WIS|

**Description**: The caster grants the target an illusory form of another entity, as long as the size category is the same. Thus the target looks, and sounds, like a different entity. The illusion is, however, only visual and auditory, so entities that do not rely on these senses will not be deceived. Likewise, it does not mask tactile stimuli. An unwilling target can negate the effect with a CHA save.

The spell does not in any way alter the abilities or physical properties of the target. Thus a close examination of the target ("prospect" or "observe" at close range) vs the Threshold of the caster, reveals the illusion. Likewise, every time an observer perceives the target to behave, smell, or produce tactile stimuli that do not match its appearance, the observer may make a WIS save to break the illusion. An observer that has broken the illusion sees the actual form of the target and no longer perceives the illusory form.

Thus, for example, if the target is disguised as a winged, and the illusory wings "clip" through a physical object, such as a bookshelf, any observers of this make a WIS save. A group may rule that particularly flagrant mismatches between appearances and observed 'behaviour' automatically break the illusion (but this is a slippery slope, and is not recommended).

**Limitations**: Entities with "tremor sense", "blind-sight" and "true sight" automatically disregard the illusion.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice above 1, the spell either lasts for an extra hour, or affects an additional target.

**Global**: The spell lasts for a week.

|Duration|1 minute|+1
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1
|Limitation|The spell is blocked by any barrier that would also block smells or movement of air/water|-1
|Save|WIS (harmless)|

**Description**: The caster casts the spell upon one target at close range. The target gains the ability to sense spells and supernatural energies and manifestations thereof that are otherwise unseen, within range. The character can detect the direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) and the distance to the nearest edge of the spell. The target can, if it is proficient with "Knowledge: Arcana", determine the type of magic used to cast the spell, and can attempt to identify exactly what it is sensing if it succeeds a ["Knowledge: Arcana"](05-skills.md#knowledge) roll made at disadvantage.

**Limitations**: This is not a "sight" ability. Thus it does not allow a character to dispel an effect while remaining at a distance from its area of effect. It is nevertheless useful for detecting dangerous, or interesting, effects that are occurring nearby.

**Upcast**: The range of the spell increases by 15ft for every extra MP  die above 1 used when casting the spell.

|Save|Dex|

**Description**: Over the course of the round you gradually shape the surface layer of earth or natural, unworked stone, manipulating material to a depth of 5ft (if earth) or 1ft if rock.
+ If this would encapsulate or otherwise trap an entity, it has enough time to use its reaction and escape the effect or do so by making a Dex save at advantage.
+ If the shape will not be structurally sound it collapses.
+ If you are attempting to make something artistic or structurally sound, you must make a "Tinker" or "Fortify" roll at disadvantage.

**Global**: If cast globally the area affected is 200ft plus 100ft per extra 4MP. In this case artistic or structurally coherent use is not possible.
(4+2)

**Upcast**: The radius increases by 5ft for every extra MP dice used. The depth increases by 5ft (1ft) for every extra 2 MP dice used. If used globally the increase of radius per every extra MP dice is 100ft.

|Components|kinetic|
|Limitation|Fails if caster and answer to the question are not both in contact with air|-2
|Limitation|Fails if the caster and answer to the question are hermetically separated|-2
|Save|-|

**Description**: The caster attempts to ascertain the location (and rough time, if it was there during the casting of the spell but is no there when the casting ends) of an object, feature or entity described by the caster, by asking low level wind spirits. The spirits will seek out he nearest example of the thing that meets the specification.

**Special**: The low level spirits answer truthfully and faithfully, but are limited to 3 physically discernable criteria in the description and do not understand many human concepts (eg belonging, names, age). Eg *"A half-elf woman in a red cloak"*, or *"an elvish woman around who the word 'Illusi' is spoken"* are valid, but *"A half-elf woman by the name of 'Illusi'"* or *"My favourite backpack"* are not.

If more than 3 criteria are chosen the lesser spirits will latch on to any three and ignore the rest.

Other users of air magic can use "knowledge:arcana" to recognise that the spell is being cast in the area and use "summon wind sprite" at a higher level to hide their location without breaking the casting.\

**Upcast:** For every extra MP die the range of the spell increases by 120ft. When cast globally, this is an extra mile per 4MP dice.

**Global**: The spell reaches to a range of four miles and gives the caster the location of all objects matching the criteria.

**Special**:
- You can only have one summon at any one time.
- The summon appears at the start of the caster's *next* turn.

**Limitation**: You cannot summon a beast into an environment where it cannot breath or move (eg, you cannot summon a horse into mid-air, or a fish onto land).

**Upcast**: For every MP dice added above 1 (4 MP dice above 4 for global), the beast gains a level.

**Global**: The beast is bound by a longer contract (an extra day for every 4MP above 4) and the spell does not require concentration.

The weird may also carry out the "grapple" or "shove"/"throw" combat manoeuvres, or make simple interactions with its environment, similar to a 15ft snake. The attack roll of the weird always uses the casters stats. (-3+3+6=4+2)

**Special**:
- If the target is an entity it may make a save to reject the spell, in which case the spell fails.
- The weird is considered to have "[Blind Sight](06-abilities.md#blind-sight-i-vi)" for the sake of its attack rolls. However it should be noted that the target of the spell must be aware of the entity being attacked to be able to command the attack.

**Upcast**: Either the damage increases by 1d12, or the reach increases by 5ft for every extra MP die above 1.

|Duration|Special: 1h, then permanent (7 days)| + 12
|Concentration|yes (yes)|-3
|Components|kinetic|
|Focus|A wilted leaf of a dead spider|-1
|Save|Con|

**Description**: Call a class C "disease" to afflict the target. Alternatively chose a single stat: The target has disadvantage with all attacks, rolls and saves governed by that stat.

|Components|incantation, kinetic|
|Focus|A black pearl|
|Material|-|
|Condition|Catatonic|
|Save|Cha (avoid effects), Wis(avoid condition)|

**Description**: Much like a shadow of ["Least Flare"](#least-flare), the caster summons a shade and binds it to a valid target, giving it the "blinded" condition. An unwilling target may break the effect with a successful Cha save, thus ending the spell. The shade reaches out and extinguishes bright light within 40ft and dim light within a total radius of 100ft. This creates an area of darkness where [ordinary vision and low-light vision](02-base-rules.md#sight) are unable to penetrate, and entities that rely on this kind of vision are effectively ["blind"](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail). Other senses are not affected. 

[angels](10-conditions-types.md#divine) within 40ft of the shade have disadvantage on attacks and saves.

As a secondary action the caster may command the shade to reach out and touch a target within 10ft. Doing this ends the darkness effect of "Dusk". The target must make a Wis save or be ["Catatonic"](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail) for a minute (repeated saves apply).

|Damage|2d12+[Sup] bludgeoning|+6 (+2 for being able to do manoeuvres and skills)
|Attack/Manoeuvre|SAP+[Wis]|
|Save|-|

**Description**: Gather a "medium" sized hand out of the earth or chipped rock at the target square. The hand is manipulated as your own. It is considered proficient with any tools and attacks/manoeuvres you are proficient in. Including on the turn it is called, you may use your main action to move the hand 20ft and carry out one of the following actions:
+ Grapple a target (SAP+[Wis]).
+ Shove/Throw a target (SAP+[Wis]).
+ Make a targeted melee attack (SAP+[Wis]).
+ Make any manipulation you can with your own hand, but at disadvantage.
+ The hand provides heavy cover for any medium sized or smaller entity behind it.

**Limitation**:
- The hand is not an entity but a spell effect.
- The physical form of the hand is not its essence. Any material destroyed by attacks against it is gathered again from the surrounding ground.
- The hand has a 5ft reach, and may not leave the ground.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice used above 2 the damage increases by 1d12 or duration increases by 1 minute. If the MP dice total is 3 or higher for a local casting, working the hand becomes a "secondary action".

### Glide
|Name|Glide [Air, Travel]|

|Casting time|"main action" or "reaction" (2h + 20 minutes per 8MP)|
|Range|60ft|+1
|Duration|12min (1 day)|+3
|Components|kinetic|
|Concentration|local|-3
|Limit|The target has no control over its fly direction or speed|-2 
|Save|Wis|

**Description**: The target is no longer attracted to the earth. This has the following effect:
- Its jump distance is by x4 the base distance of the roll (after that it slows down and stops).
- When jumping upwards it will hang at the maximum height instead of returning to earth.
- When moving at more than than half its speed, the target must make a threshold=20 acrobatics roll or end up hanging mid-air at an altitude of a few feet.
- When airborne as a result of this spell, a target is carried by the wind at half of the wind's speed.

**Special**: The spell can be cast as a reaction when a target begins to fall. If cast as a reaction, the target descends at ~60ft per round. If cast as a main action on a target that is already falling, it begins to decelerate. This does nothing if the fall distance is less than ~360ft. Otherwise, if the fall is long, for every round the spell effects the target it decelerates 20ft per round (from 360ft), decreasing fall damage by 2d12 per round of falling, to an eventual safe speed of 60ft.

**Global**: When cast globally the spell creates a spherical zone centered on the caster where this effect acts. For every 8 extra MP dice added the zone is expanded by 200ft or the duration increased by a day. Every entity that enters the area and does not succeed a Wis save is affected by the spell.

**Description**: Obtain a day's worth of *unprepared* food and water for a large mortal of your choice (or 4 medium). In doing so the vitality of the ground in the casting area is depleted until the end of the next harvest season. (+2+8)

**Upcast**: The amount harvested increases by 1 large mortal's worth of food and water for every extra MP dice above 2. The radius increases by 5ft for every extra 2MP dice above 2.

**Special**: Harvester mages are often used by marching or retreating armies for logistics and scorched earth. There would likely be ramifications to using this magic, especially on inhabited or claimed lands.
- If the land is marginally fertile (eg fells, swamp, mountains) the harvest is 1/4 of the usual.
- If the land is infertile (eg ruins, city, subterranean, desert), the MP is expended and the harvest fails.

**Global**: The radius increases to 100ft per 8MP dice. The amount of sustenance obtained is enough for 200 large (800 medium) mortals per 8MP.

All valid targets in a radius of 100ft are "invisible" for a week. For every 4MP, the radius increases by 100ft, or the duration increases by a week.

|Limitation|Global: The spell is weakened if the target is not willing.|
|Limitation|Local: The target must be willing.|
|Save|Special: Wis|

**Description**: The caster makes a target's promise hold real power. Chose a condition no higher than "B Class" from the table below. The spell then takes one of the following forms:
1. The target makes a promise and must fulfil it before the spell ends or suffers the condition permanently. (eg, "I will slay the ogre that terrorises the village."). The condition can still be dispelled as if it was the "Promise" spell cast with the same number of MP dice.
2. The target makes a promise and must either keep fulfilling it for the duration of the spell. (eg, "I promise not to deceive you."). If the target breaks the promise, it suffers the condition for the full duration of the spell (as if it was cast when the target broke the promise).

The condition counts as having a "supernatural" origin.

|Class|Description|
|-|-|
|C|The target gains the "glowing", "aphonia" or "deafened" condition|
|C|The target falls "prone" at the end of each of its turns|
|C|Specify a skill: If the target rolls above a 10 for this skill, its total is a 10|
|B|The target is "grappled" at the end of each of its turns, it may make a grapple roll as an attack action to attempt to break it at the start of it turn|
|B|The target is "blinded"|
|B|The target starts all combats "surprised"|
|B|The target is charmed by the first entity it sees or hears after it breaks the promise|
|B|The target has disadvantage on all targeted attacks governed by one attribute of the caster's choice|
|B|The target has disadvantage on all saves governed by one attribute of the caster's choice|
|B|The target's base movement speed is halved|
|A|The target is "restrained" at the end of each of its turns, it may make a grapple roll as an attack action to attempt to break it at the start of it turn|
|A|The target is "incapacitated"|
|A|The target is "crippled"|
|A|The target has vulnerability to one damage type|
|S|The target is "immobilised" at the end of each of its turns, it may make a grapple roll as an attack action to attempt to break it at the start of it turn|

**Special**: If the target is not aware that it is being bound, or makes the promise against its will, it may attempt a Wis save if it ever brakes the promise. On a success it avoids the effects of the spell.

**Global**: The spell lasts for a month.

**Upcast (Global only)**: The spell lasts for an extra month per 4 MP dice placed in it. In addition, at 12 MP dice, an A class condition may be selected, and at 16 MP dice, an S Class conditions may be selected.

**Description**: The caster imbues one target with the ability to trace out a "[secret path](03-movement-exploration.md#secret-paths)". The path is traced between the place where the spell is cast, and where the spell ends. The spell can be completed prematurely by speaking a pre-agreed completion word. The target of the spell knows the secret path and can find and follow it. They can share this information with other entities they can communicate with. Travelling this secret path takes one round per 12 minutes of duration of the spell.

**Special**: The secret path exists for a number of days equal to the caster's character level. However, other entities may end up finding and using or inhabiting this path.

**Limitation**: 
- If "Secret Path" is learned through "air", "earth", "fire" or "water" magic, it can only be cast if at least one of the locations it connects is associated with the element, or its season. 
- If "Secret Path" is cast through "nature" magic, it cannot connect two locales created through artifice (eg, cities, castles, houses, ships, etc).
- The secret path MUST be between two areas in the same realm, or between adjacent realms (eg, one can trace a path between the material realm and a shallow layer of the spirit realm, or a shallow and intermediate layer of the spirit realm, but not between material realm and intermediate or deep layer of the spirit realm).
- The spell ends if the target attempts to travel via "cosmic speed", or through other supernatural means such as "[Fairy Shelter](#fairy-shelter)", "[Aqueous Step](#aqueous-step)", "[Flame Stride](#flame-stride)", "[Fairy Feast](#fairy-feast)", "[Portal](#portal)", although it does function with "[Otherworld Step](#otherworld-step)" and "[Fairy Ball/Masquerade](#fairy-ballmasquerade)".

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice above 2 spent, the spell lasts for an extra 12 minutes.

**Global**:
- The spell lasts for 1 day (plus 1 day per extra 4MP dice).
- The secret path exists for a number of months equal to the caster's character level. However, every month there is a 1/6 chance that the path shifts and the location and route are no longer known to the caster. Other entities might find, use and inhabit the paths created by this spell.

**Special**:
- After 60 minutes the undead is not destroys, but persists, becoming hostile to its creator.
- There is no limit to the number of undead a caster can control, however legions of dead seldom end well.

+ If the command involves harming an entity with which its relationship is "sworn", or helping an entity with which its relationship is "nemesis" it gets an additional save against the spell.

|Material|A brass bowl filled with earth, the bowl crumbles when the spell is cast|(3)
|Save|Cha, harmless|

**Description**: Create a solid, physical barrier of earth with a radius of **up to** 15ft around the target. The barrier gives total cover and total concealment to targets within it. Dealing physical damage to the barrier (HiT=10, HP=10, damage reduction(except "esoteric")=10) in one turn opens a window big enough for a small size entity to enter freely (or a medium entity to squeeze through). At the end of the turn the barrier resets.

**Limitation**:
- If, while the spell is active, the target of the spell moves or was moved since the start of the caster's last turn, the caster must make a Threshold=15 concentration save or lose the spell. This save is eschewed if the spell is cast with at least 5 MP dice.

**Special**:
- If the spell is cast as a reaction, it cannot be upcast, and lasts for 1 minute.
- If the attack is a rectilinear effect and the barrier crosses its path, the target is affected as if it is inside the barrier.
- Effects caused by area of effect "earth" spells of an equal or lower level that do not require an attack roll are excluded from the spell's area of effect. 

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice above 3 placed in the spell, the radius extends by 5ft, or the duration increases by 1h.
- If the spell is cast as a reaction, it cannot be upcast.
- At 5MP and higher the spell is no longer concentration.

**Global:** This is one of the lesser barrier spells. Cast globally it extends over a radius of 300ft centered on a square/point and lasts for a week. For every 4MP extra either the duration increases by a week or the radius increases by 200ft.

**Description**: Beseech a fey to allow several beings to shelter in its realm. The entities follow a hidden path (takes 1 round regardless of speed) to enter the fey's realm. The realm is habitable for all beings.

Access to the fey's realm is by a "secret path". The spell give the targets knowledge of the path. At the end of the spell this particular "secret path" ceases to exist.
- It takes 1 round (regardless of move speed) to follow the secret path, during this time the targets are considered to be outside of the material realm.
- Other entities can find the shelter via a ["Knowledge: Arcana"](05-skills.md#knowledge) roll to identify an effect (at least 20), and a subsequent "navigate" roll equal to the caster's spell threshold.
- Uninvited entities can only enter the Fey's realm upon succeeding a WIS save vs the caster's Threshold. However, even if the uninvited guest succeeds, it may face the displeasure of the master of the realm.

**Special (global)**: The fey will ask the caster to make a [promise](#promise) (as per the spell) in exchange for the shelter. The promise may be trivial, ridiculous, or deadly serious, depending on the fey that the caster deals with.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice above 3 added to the spell, the shelter will accept an additional guest.

**Global**: The spell lasts for four hours. The fey will ask a "promise" to be made in exchange (see above).

 ### Illusory Self
|Name|Illusory Self [Illusion, Kinetic, Water, Winter]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|3 (6)|
|Target(s)|1 entity|
|Casting time|1 main action (3 hours + 20 minutes per 4MP dice)|
|Range|close|-1
|Duration|1 hour (1 week)|6(5)
|Components|kinetic|
|Focus|A small mirror|-1
|Limitation|This spell is defeated by true sight|-2(3)
|Save|CHA/WIS|

**Description**: The caster grants the target an illusory form of another entity, as long as the size category is within one size category of itself. Thus the target looks, and sounds, like a different entity. The illusion affects all senses. An unwilling target can negate the effect with a CHA save.

The spell does not in any way alter the abilities or physical properties of the target. Thus a close examination of the target ("prospect" or "observe" at close range) vs the Threshold of the caster, reveals the illusion. Likewise, every time an observer perceives the target to behave in a manner impossible for its appearance, the observer may make a WIS save to break the illusion. An observer that has broken the illusion sees the actual form of the target and no longer perceives the illusory form.

Thus, for example, if the target is disguised as an orc, but is actually a winged and takes flight, creating strong gusts of wind with their wings, any observers of this make a WIS save. A group may rule that particularly flagrant mismatches between appearances and observed 'behaviour' automatically break the illusion (but this is a slippery slope, and is not recommended).

**Limitations**:
- Entities with "true sight" automatically disregard the illusion.
- While the illusion has a tactile component, it does not create actual matter. Thus illusory claws would feel sharp to the touch, but cannot harm you.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice above 3, the spell either lasts for an extra hour, or affects an additional target.

**Global**: The spell lasts for a week.

|A|The target has vulnerability to one damage type|
|S|The target is "immobilised" at the end of each of its turns, it may make a grapple roll as an attack action to attempt to break it at the start of it turn|


**Special**:

- If the target fails the initial save, it is affected by the curse for the full duration and does not make repeated saves.
- Poison or Disease class depends on the class of the individual poison or disease.

|Duration|12 minutes (1 day)|+3
|Components|kinetic|
|Focus||
|Material||
|Limitation||
|Save|WIS (harmless)|

**Description**: The caster casts the spell upon one target at close range. The target gains the ability to see spells and supernatural energies and manifestations thereof that are otherwise unseen, within range. The target might not be able to identify exactly what it is seeing unless it succeeds a ["Knowledge: Arcana"](05-skills.md#knowledge) roll.

**Limitations**: This spell does not give one the ability to see invisible entities or objects, although if the entity is made invisible by a spell, then the target will be able to see the supernatural emanations around it, hence being able to localise it to the squares that it occupies.

**Upcast**: The range of the spell increases by 30ft for every extra MP die above 3 in the spell.

|Limitation|An entity that does not sleep is unaffected by this spell|-1
|Limitation|An entity can be awoken using a main action to deal 1 point of HP damage to it|-1
|Damage|Special|-1
|Save|INT|

**Description**: The caster causes the target entity to fall asleep (unconscious) on a failed INT save. The target repeats the save at the start of each turn, awakening on a successful save (if it lives long enough).

**Special**: A target, if it fails the save, may instead choose to to take SP damage equal to the SP of the caster, plus 1 point of HP damage, and hence avoid the effect of the spell. In order to make use of this possibility the target must be proficient with "[Knowledge: Arcana](05-skills.md#knowledge)" and successfully identify the spell (Threshold of at least 15). (The mechanistic reason for this, is because unconsciousness, in this system, is extremely dangerous, so players are given the option of avoiding the effect, for a heavy, heavy toll.)

**Upcast**: The spell affects an additional target for each extra MP die above 3.

**Global**: The target falls asleep permanently, and remains in a deep, stasis-like sleep. The caster must give a plausible condition of the target's awakening.

In addition to the normal effects, if it is cast in the [Destruction] modality, "profane" entities gain +1 to all saves in the area, and "divine" entities a -1 penalty to all saves. If the spell is cast in the [Healing] modality this is reversed.

|Focus|Flower of a Black Dhalia|-1
|Material|An item or memory precious to the caster or target(if voluntary)|-2
|Limitation|Does not affect True-sight|-2
|Save|WIS/INT|

**Description**: The caster touches the aura of a target being, making the target appear as if it was another being or object to supernatural senses, magics and spells. Thus, for example the caster can make a child appear to be a dragon for the sake of a spell such as "[Scry](#scry)" or "[Spirits' Secret](#spirits-secret)", or make themselves appear to be an entirely different individual. This does not affect the target's appearance for the sake of natural senses such as normal sight or scent.

An unwilling target can negate the effect with a successful WIS save vs the caster's threshold. The save is not repeated.

If the detection spell is cast at a higher MP dice cost (level) than "False Aura", the target of "False Aura" must succeed on an INT save vs the Threshold of the detection spell, or have its real "aura" be revealed. The same applies for "S class" supernatural senses and magics.

**Special (local only)**: If the target is willing, the caster and target can exchange "auras" instead. Hence the target will appear to be the caster to supernatural/magical senses and spells, while the caster will appear to be the target.

**Special**: If the target is disguised as a specific being (eg, 'I disguise my aura as Fana Luine's") or place, is observed by an observer familiar with the new aura, the must make an INT save (at advantage), even for lower level spells or abilities. If the spell is of a higher "level" than the casting of "False Aura", the INT save is made at disadvantage.

**Limitation**: Beings with "[Truesight](06-abilities.md#truesight-i-v) are not affected by the deception of this spell. 

**Upcast**: For every extra die above 4 expended when casting the spell, the spell lasts for an extra 8 hours, or affects an extra target. Secondly the spell is automatically effective against spells cast up to that "spell level" (INT save is no longer needed).

**Global**: The spell instead affects a volume with a radius of 120ft, centered on a point on the ground or a stationary object. Likewise it lasts for 4 months. For every 4 extra MP dice, either the radius increases by 120ft, or the duration increases by 4 months.

|Material|- (1HP worth of the creator's blood)|-2
|Limitation||
|Save|CHA|

**Description**: The caster creates a domain outside of the material world (generally on the border of the spirit realm and the material world). The domain is not necessarily a sphere, but is contained in a space of 40ft x 40ft x 40ft. The domain has an environment that is associated with the elemental spellcasting used to create it, but is habitable for entities of the caster's race. The caster determines the details of this domain, but it contains no living beings and no works of artifice. Though it may contain natural formations that could serve certain functions (such as a flat stone that could act as a table).

If the spell is cast using the element of "air" or "fire", the domain is open and can be lit by a light that resembles starlight or sunlight. Other parts of the spirit realm may be visible as distant specks of light or darkness.

If the spell is cast using the element of "earth" or "water" it is unlit and completely enclosed.

The space is cut off from reality and imperceptible from the material world. Likewise, outside realms are imperceptible and inaccessible from the domain (with a few exceptions). The caster is aware of the presence and count of other entities in their domain, though their location and nature is not revealed.

This space can only be accessed by either a secret path, by using "[Otherworld Step](#otherworld-step)", or by entities with a cosmic speed.
- The caster knows and can follow the secret path to enter this realm (takes 2 rounds regardless of move speed). Entities that follow the caster may make a "navigate" roll vs the caster's threshold in order to learn the secret path.
- Only entities that know the location of the domain can enter it via "Otherworld Step".
- Entities with a cosmic speed can find the domain with a Threshold=30 ["navigate"](05-skills.md#navigate) roll.
- Other entities can find the domain via an ["Knowledge: Arcana"](05-skills.md#knowledge) roll to identify an effect (at least 20), and a subsequent "navigate" roll equal to the caster's spell threshold.


Any entity that tries to enter the domain via the secret path, but fails, returns to where it started. In doing so, it expends 4 MP dice due to the hardships of journey between the material and immaterial realm.

Any entity that attempts to enter the domain, but is not invited by the caster, can only do so upon making a successful CHA save vs the caster's threshold. Upon failure it expends 4 MP dice.

An entity can attempt to leave the domain if it so wishes. However, if it does so without knowledge of the path, it follows the same rules as entities entering the domain under similar conditions.

When the spell ends, the remaining entities within it find themselves at the point in the material world where the spell was cast.

**Limitation**: A caster must have at least 1 level in all 4 elemental spellcasting abilities in order to be able to use this spell safely. If the caster does not know all the elements, there is a chance of instead creating a shadow space inhabited by 2d8 hostile [Cursed Shades](monsters-npcs/profanes.md#cursed-shade-lesser). The probability is as follow: For 3 elements known, 25%. For 2, 50%. For 1, 75%.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 4, the spell lasts for an extra 12 minutes.

**Special**: A caster can only ever have ONE domain. If the spell is recast, the previous domain disappears.

**Global**: The spell lasts for 1 day. At the end of the day, the caster may decide at the end of this period whether to make the domain permanent.

**NB**: The text of the spell has presumed something about the nature of the game world, however it is reasonable to reflavour the spell if the nature of teh game world is not consistent with the description. Furthermore, this spell presumes the existence of other dimensions, planes, realms, or with the possibility of spatial distortions that are otherwise separate from the "real" or "material" world. In games where this is not the case, the group should consider whether it is reasonable and possible to include this spell in the game.

|Save|Wis|

**Description**: The caster creates an illusionary scene which mimics the real scene to all senses except touch and pain. It can do no damage. The scene realistically mimics a real scene, at first glance, but has no material substance. For example:
- An illusionary bridge over a river will hold no weight, but if a rock is thrown against might show the rock bouncing a few steps along the bridge and coming to rest on it (in the meanwhile the real rock passes straight through it).
- An illusionary bonfire would feel warm at a distance, but would fail to melt a block of ice at some distance (although if the ice is placed inside of the area of the "mirage" it would *appear* to melt).

An illusion can be broken in the following manner:
- At a distance, when interacting with the illusion from outside of it, an entity may attempt to disbelieve, and roll a Wis save at disadvantage against the caster's threshold.
- When interacting with the "mirage" from inside it, it may attempt disbelieve it and roll a Wis save against the caster's threshold.
- When an entity interacts with the "mirage" in such a way that the "mirage" seems implausible or suspicious (eg a bonfire failing to melt a block of ice, or the target falling through the bridge), it may roll a Wis save at advantage.
- If the entity has some magic sense, it makes a Wis save against the "mirage" as soon as it detects it.
- If the entity has "true seeing" it automatically sees through the "mirage"

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 4, the duration increases by 12 min or the radius increases by 5ft.

**Global**: The mirage lasts for a day and has a radius of 400ft. For every 4 extra MP the mirage lasts for an extra day or its radius increases by 400ft.

|Target(s)|1 entity|
|Casting time|1 action (5 hours + 1 hour per MP die)|
|Range|30ft|
|Duration|1 hour (1 week+)|
|Components|incantation, kinetic|
|Concentration|local|
|Limitation|Only affects mortals|
|Save|WIS/CHA|

**Description**: The caster attempts to dominate the mind of a mortal, triggering a WIS save at the start of the target's next turn. If the target fails the save, it is "[dominated](10-conditions-types.md#dominated)" by the caster until the end of the spell. The target does not get repeated saves against the effect unless certain conditions are met (see below).

When dominated the target takes no action or reactions (other than movement or communication). Secondly the caster can use any of its own actions through the dominated target. This happens on the caster's turn (although reactions can obviously occur at any time).

**Special**:
+ Actions taken through the target by the caster use the target's stats, skills, proficiencies, abilities, movement speed and modalities, but the caster's [actions](04-combat.md#actions-in-combat).
+ The target is aware that it is not in control of its body. It can identity the origin of the effect by succeeding a "knowledge:arcana" roll.
+ The target retains all memories of its actions while dominated. If it recognises who dominated it, it also retains this memory.
+ If a command involves harming itself, or an entity with which its relationship is "sworn", or helping an entity with which its relationship is "nemesis" it gets an additional save against the spell at advantage. The save is a CHA save.
+ If the target receives "divine" or "entropic" damage while under effect of the spell, the spell ends.

**Global**: The spell lasts for a week, and is not concentration. For every 4 MP dice extra, the spell lasts for an extra day.

|Damage|2d8+[Nat] fire|+6(13)

**Description**: The caster blinks to a chosen location that is not inside a solid object. The caster may take up to 2 other entities with it. An unwilling passenger does not travel if it succeeds a Cha save. Any entity that travelled this way deals 2d8+[Sup] fire damage on its next attack.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 5 the range increases by 60ft or the number of passengers increases by 1.

**Global**: Enter a bonfire large enough to engulf the caster and emerge from another of their choice in range (200 miles). The caster is aware of all valid fires in range.
- For every 4 extra MP dice the range increases by 60 miles or the number of passengers increases by 1.

|Casting time|"1 main action" (5 hours + 20 minutes per 4 MP dice)|
|Range|30ft|+2
|Duration|8 hours (1 month)|+9(11)
|Components|kinetic|
|Focus|A flower associated with daylight, or a crystal|-1(10)
|Damage|3d6+[SUP] light|+9(19)
|Concentration|local|
|Save|Cha (avoid effects), Dex (half damage)|

**Description**: The caster summons a mote of light and binds it to a valid target, giving it the "glowing" condition. An unwilling target may break the effect with a successful Cha save, thus ending the spell. The mote sheds bright light in 120ft and dim light in total radius of 300ft.

Incorporeal ["undead"](10-conditions-types.md#profane) and ["fiends"](10-conditions-types.md#profane) have disadvantage on attacks and saves within the radius of the bright light.

As a secondary action the caster may dismiss the flare, causing 3d6+[SUP] damage to all targets within 30ft of the mote and hence ending the spell. All entities that take damage from the light must succeed a CON save or be "blinded". The effect is permanent until cured.

**Upcast**:  For each extra MP die above 1 the spell may last for an extra 8 hours or the radius of bright and dim light increase each by 20ft.

**Global**: If the spell is cast globally, it must be anchored to a stationary target. If the target is moved from its square(s), the spell ends. Secondly the spell causes no damage if dismissed. The spell lasts for a month and the radius of bright light is 2400ft (or about half a mile). For every extra MP dice, the radius increases by 400ft, and the duration increases by 1 month.

### Flawed Transmute
|Name|Flawed Transmutation [Curse, Incantation]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|5 (10)|

|Casting time|1 action (5 hours + 20 minutes per 4MP dice)|
|Range|close|
|Duration|1 day (permanent)|+24
|Components|incantation|+1(25)
|Focus|A vial of clean water, a vial of clean air, a vial of earth, smouldering embers|-2(23)
|Material|A cup of the caster's blood|-2(21)
|Limitation|The material level of the object cannot be higher than 2|-2(19)
|Limitation|The material level of the object decreases by 1|-2(17)
|Limitation|The gold value of the final object cannot be higher than the value of the initial option|-2(15)
|Limitation|The size of the transmuted object in volume is the same as the initial object|-2(13)
|Save|Charisma (if wielded by an entity, or is magical), not otherwise|

**Description**: Transmute a target object, no more than 5ft x 5ft x 5ft in volume from one substance to another. The shape of the object remains the same. Thus if you transform a shield from steel to salami, it will still retain the form of a shield.

**Special**: The final substance has to be in the same element/state as the initial substance. Thus a caster cannot use this spell to turn water into air, but can turn water into (poor) wine. Likewise it can be used to turn steel into cheese, but not into bad air.

**Upcast**: For every addition MP die above 5 used in the casting, either add an extra object or increase its size by one category. If at least 7 MP dice are used the maximum material level can be 3. If 9 MP dice are used the maximum material level can be 4.

**Global**: The spell is permanent. If at least 28 MP dice are used the maximum material level can be 3. If 36 MP dice are used the maximum material level can be 4.

### Flood
|Name|Lesser Flood [Autumn, Destruction, Nature, Water, Winter]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|5 (20)|
|Target(s)|50ft radius (or 100ft. 60 degree cone)| 11
|Casting time|1 full round action (2 days + 5 hours per 4MP dice)| -2 (9)
|Range|120ft (close for cone)| 4 (13)
|Duration|Instantaneous|
|Components|kinetic|
|Limitation|Special (see below)|
|Damage|3d12 Pressure[Natural]| 9 (22)
|Conditions|Special| 2 (23)
|Save|STR, DEX|-1

**Description**: Violently summons 65,000 cubic feet of water (enough to fill 520 5ft cubes) which spreads in a catastrophic deluge that spreads to the full radius of effect of the spell. Thereafter the water remains and spreads naturally as naturally occurring water would without causing further damage, but may sweep away small objects to an extent.

Any entity within the area of effect that does not succeed a STR save suffers 3d12 natural pressure damage, and is moved to the edge of the spell's range of effect (this is a "grapple" effect) and falls prone. In addition any entity within 25ft of the origin of the spell must succeed a DEX save or immediately begin "[suffocating](03-movement-exploration.md#characters-starvation-and-other-bad-ways-to-die)" (NB: since the spell is instantaneous they do not take any damage, however refractory period is immediately triggered).

**Limitation**: If the spell is cast through "NATURE" magic, it can only be cast if there are at least 5 5ft cubes of water or if it is raining or snowing in the proposed area of effect.

**Note**: 65,000 cubic feet is enough to fill a 3m deep, 25m swimming pool.

**Upcast**: The Spell's radius increases by 10ft and the volume of water produced increases by 200 5ft cubes (13,000 cubic feet) for every extra MP dice above 5. Alternatively the damage increases by 1d12.

**Global**: The spell's radius increases to a radius of 1000ft. The volume of water produced is enough to submerge an area of 5sq miles to a depth of 50ft. The water takes 1 minute to spread over the area.  Every round an entity must succeed a swim roll (vs caster's Threshold) to reach the surface or suffer 3d6 damage. Structures automatically take 3 dice of damage every round, and are usually swept away.

___
### Greater Fade
|Name|Greater Fade [Air, Nature, Spirit]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|5 (10)|
|Target(s)|1 entity (120ft radius)|
|Casting time|1 full round action (5 hours + 20 minutes per 4MP dice)|-2
|Range|close|-2 
|Duration|1 day (1 year)|+12
|Components|Incantation, Kinetic|-1
|Focus|A talisman made of material from a hidden valley|-1
|Save|WIS/INT|

**Description**: The target of the spell may attempt to go unnoticed in areas watched by various scrying magics or within wards such as "[Warded Ground](#warded-ground)". An unwilling target may negate the effect with a successful WIS save.

If the level (MP dice cost of the local spell) of the detection magic is equal to, or lower than that at which "Greater Fade" is cast, the detection magic fails to detect the target. The same applies if detection is by a supernatural ability of "A class" or lower.

If the level of the detection magic is higher, or if detection is by an "S class" ability, then, in order for "Greater Fade" to be effective", its target must succeed an INT save vs the Threshold of the one who cast the detection magic, when the detection magic would normally first detect it. Repeated saves do not apply.

**Upcast**: For every extra die above 5 expended when casting the spell, the spell lasts for an extra day, or affects an extra target. Secondly the spell is automatically effective against spells cast up to that "spell level" (INT save is no longer needed).

**Global**: The spell instead affects a volume with a radius of 120ft, centered on a point on the ground or a stationary object. Likewise it lasts 1 year. For every 4 extra MP dice, either the radius increases by 120ft, or the duration increases by 4 months.

|Duration|12 minutes (1 day)|+12(22)
|Components|incantation,kinetic|-1(21)
|Focus|A totem of volcanic pumice|-1(20)
|Material|A handful of ash|-1(19)
|Limitation|Cannot be used if the area of effect overlaps with global water magic|-2(17)
|Concentration|local|-3(14)
|Damage|3d8+[Sup] Fire|+9(23)
|Save|Dex/Cha (see below)|

**Description**: The caster calls flame to protect and ward an area and its perimeter is ringed by motes of flame. The barrier gives light concealment to all targets within. Entities inside the barrier have damage reduction of 10 vs non-magical physical or cold/ice attacks, regardless of their origin. In addition they have advantage against on saves against the effects of fire spells, and those caused by elemental fire. Furthermore, the caster specifies "contain", "exclude" or "both". This gives the following effects:
- Any entity on the perimeter of the area of effect, or within 5ft of it, when the ward is activated takes 4d8+[Sup] fire damage unless it succeeds a DEX save (for half).
- Any entity or object that attempts to cross (including in making a melee attack/martial manoeuvre) the perimeter takes 4d8+[Sup] fire damage.
  - If the ward was called as "contain", this damage occurs when an entity or object crosses out of the ward.
  - If the ward was called as "exclude", this damage occurs when an entity or object crosses into the ward.
- Any entities aligned with "water" can only enter (or leave) the area if they succeed a CHA save.

**Limitation**: This spell fails if its area of effect would overlap with the area of effect of a global water/ice spell.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice above 5 (local) placed into the spell, the spell radius increases by 10ft or the damage increases by 1d8 and the damage reduction increases by 4.

**Global**: The spell lasts for a day and has a radius of 800ft. For every extra 4 MP dice, the radius increases by 200ft, or the damage increases by 1d8. Likewise, the duration increases by 1 day.

___
### Heart Ward

|Casting time|"1 main action" (5 hours + 20 minutes per 4MP dice)|
|Range|30ft|+2
|Duration|1 hour (1 week)|+6()
|Components|incantation|
|Save|CHA|

**Description**: Wards the heart and mind of target entities. The caster selects one condition of "aphonia", "charmed", "frightened", and gives all the targets of the spell immunity to that condition.

**Special**: If the target is already affected by the warded condition, the condition is suppressed for the duration of the spell.

**Upcast**: For every MP die above 5, the spell can either:
- target an extra 2 entities, or,
- last for an extra hour, or,
- grant immunity to an additional condition (from the three listed).

**Global**: The spell last for 1 week. For every 4 MP dice above 20, the spell lasts for an extra week.

___
### Isolate Essence

|Range|60ft|
|Duration|1 hour (1 month)|
|Components|Kinetic|
|Material|A locket with an empty canvas, which gains the target's likeness if the spell is cast successfully|
|Limitation|If the canvas within the locket is destroyed, the spell is broken|
|Save|CHA|

**Description**: The caster places a seal on part of the target's essence, hence stopping it from using a skill or ability. The caster specifies a skill or ability (for example, "Divine Strike" or "Acrobatics"). If the target does not succeed a CHA save vs the caster's Threshold, it cannot use that skill/ability for the duration of the spell.
- If a skill is lost, the target can still make rolls, however it is treated as having zero ranks and no [base] in the skill.
- If an ability is lost, the target cannot use it. If the ability has several levels, the highest available level is sealed.

**Special**:
- The spell can be cast multiple times on the same target specifying the same skill/ability or a different one. If the same ability is targeted, the next level down is lost. Thus if "Isolate Essence" is cast 3 times on a target with "Greater Manoeuvre III", each time specifying "Greater Manoeuvre", the target may lose all three levels of the ability for the duration. Specifying the same ability more times than the ability has levels simply wastes the spell.

**Limitation**:
- If the canvas within the locket, which is used as the material component is destroyed, the spell is broken.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice above 5, the spell can target an extra ability/skill (or the same one again) or last for an extra hour.

**Global**: The spell spell lasts for 1 month. For every 4 MP dice above 20 it lasts for an extra month or seals an extra level of the same ability.

|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1
|Focus|The symbol of a deity|-1
|Material (global only)|1 oz of dragon blood used to draw the seal|-2
|Limitation|Special| -4
|Save|CHA|

**Description**: The spell creates a seal within a 10ft radius of a point warding it against cosmic forces. This barrier has three effects within its area of effect while it is active:
- Everything in the AoE has resistance to "[entropic damage](10-conditions-types.md#esoteric-damage)".
- All secret paths that start or end in the area of effect are unusable.
- An entity that wishes to enter or leave the area by "cosmic" or "blink" speed, or through the use of a spell or supernatural ability must succeed on a CHA sav vs the caster's Threshold, or fail.

**Special**: If the spell is cast as a reaction, it has a duration of 1 minute and cannot be upcast.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 5 used to cast the spell, the radius increases by 10ft, or the range increases by 30ft.

**Global**: The spell has a radius of 200ft and a duration of 1 month. For every extra 4MP die used, the duration increases by a month or the radius increases by 200ft.

|Limitation|Global: The spell is weakened if the target is not willing.|-1(11)
|Limitation|Local: The target must be willing.|-1(11)
|Save|Special: Wis|

**Description**: The caster allows a supernatural pact to be sealed between two targets (supplicant and patron). The caster may be one of the targets. "Pact" may work in the following manner:
1. Replicate the effect of "[Promise](#promise)", with a year long duration. Furthermore, the patron knows if the promise has been broken.
2. Chose a one of the patrons attributes: a stat, save, resource pool, ability, skill, or proficiency. A number of times a day equal to the supplicant's [Base], the supplicant may use that attribute (in place of their own as appropriate). *In return* the patron must demand that the supplicant make a promise (as in "[Promise](#promise)") or alternatively the patron may issue a single command to the supplicant on any day that the patron's power is borrowed.

**Special**:
- A supplicant can have a pact with no more than one patron.
- If a supplicant makes a pact under duress or unwittingly, they may make a Wis save whenever the patron issues a command or if the promise is broken.

**Global**: The spell lasts for a year. Likewise, it is possible to form a pact with an unwilling target, although in this case it may break the pact with a successful Wis save.

**Upcast (Global only)**: For every 4 MP dice above 20, the spell lasts an extra year. Alternatively you may select an extra attribute. If the spell is cast with 32 MP dice or more, and only one attribute is taken, it becomes permanent.

___
### Plague
|Name|Plague [Nature, Curse]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|5 (10)|
|Target(s)|3 entities (300ft radius)|
|Casting time|main action (5 hours + 20 minutes per 4MP dice)|
|Range|120 feet (300ft)|
|Duration|1 minute (1 day, special)|
|Components|kinetic|
|Focus|-|
|Material|A rodent's liver, or a handful of dried earth|
|Save|CON|

**Description**: The caster causes a virulent and violent illness to descend upon 3 target entities in range. At the start of their turns the targets must succeed on a CON save or be afflicted by the acute phase of the illness with no incubation period. The caster chooses any two base Stats: The target has disadvantage on ALL rolls that are governed by those stats. For the duration of the spell (no repeated save). For example, if the caster chooses STR and DEX, the target has disadvantage on all strength and dex based attacks, skills, and saves, as well as miscellaneous rolls based on those Stats.

At the end of the spell, the acute phase ends, but the targets make a *second* CON save. If they fail this save, the target becomes a carrier. After 24 hours the disease progresses into one of those specified on the disease table (TODO).

**Upcast**: For every MP die above 5, the caster may select an extra 2 targets.

**Global**: Create a zone of pestilence with a radius of 300ft that lasts for a day (the caster must select the disease at the start of the casting). All entities that enter the zone must make a CON save at dusk, or become diseased. From that point they are considered carriers and at dawn they enter the acute phase of the disease (this acts like the local spell- see above).

The zone of pestilence can be detected with a [Heal](05-skills.md#heal) roll or ["Knowledge: Arcana"](05-skills.md#knowledge) roll vs a threshold of [8 + MP dice used to cast the spell].

|Target(s)|1 entity|
|Casting time|24 hours|-2
|Range|close|
|Duration|1 day|+3
|Components|incantation, kinetic|
|Focus|An item that the target has a strong emotional attachment to.|-1
|Material|Sanctified Earth, and oils which are set on fire and consumed|-2
|Limitation|See below| -4
|Save|Special|

**Description**: The caster performs an intricate ritual and attempts to return a deceased entity back to the mortal realm for one short day (24 hours). The target entity's vessel/body is not needed and is provided by the magic. Likewise the revenant carries equipment/garments it was typically associated with/attached to, unless they are in the possession of another entity.

It returns to the world of the living at dawn if is diurnal (or at dusk if it is nocturnal), appearing before the caster, wherever they may be, as long as it is in the mortal realm, and not sealed by appropriate barriers. The revenant stays in the mortal realm for 24 hours. When its time has expired, its spirit is drawn back to the afterlife, and any physical form it held crumbles to dust if it has not already been destroyed.

The target returns with all of its SP and MP and up to 12 HP.

**Limitations**:
- The entity must be a mortal.
- The entity must have a dice total (MP + SP) no more than twice the dice total of the caster.
- The entity is not beholden to the caster and it is not obliged to obey the caster, although it may if it is so inclined.
-  Likewise the target entity and any divine/spiritual/profane that holds its soul is aware of who is trying return it and may attempt to resist. In this case the caster may disengage fom the ritual or try to force it. If the caster tries to force the issue, the target and caster make an opposed SAP roll. If the caster wins the ritual succeeds (although the caster may wish that it hadn't). If the ritual fails, the spell fails [catastrophically](07-magic-and-spellcasting.md#the-catastrophic-cascade) as if the spell was countered on the caster's location.
- The spell can NEVER be cast on the same target more than once a month.

**Special**: The spell can be cast up to 7 times for the same target. However, on each casting following the first time, either the caster or an entity with at least as many MP or SP dice as the caster's total must be sacrificed (it must die in the ritual). If the sacrifice is not satisfactory, the life is lost but nothing is summoned.

**Upcast**: For each 8MP dice put into the spell, the target stays in the mortal realm for an extra 24 hours.

___
### Rift

|Duration|Instantaneous|
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1(0)
|Material|An earthenware vessel, which is broken as the spell is cast|-2(-2)
|Save|DEX|

**Description**: The caster shatters the earth, opening one linear rift on the ground. The spell affects worked and unworked ground, rock and structures.

The rift can be no more than 50ft wide, 400ft long and 200ft deep, the sides are jagged and uneven. Any entity in the area of the rift when it opens, falls if it does not succeed on a DEX saving throw. If the rift is wider than the entity, the entity falls into the rift. For every point the entity fails its DEX saving throw by, it will fall 10ft into the rift. So if it fails the save by 6, it will fall 60ft and takes the corresponding damage.

**Special**:
- Structures that straddle the rift are destroyed, and terrain is permanently altered. The rift remains after the spell is cast.
- Climbing the sides of the rift requires a climb roll of Threshold=20.
- The caster can specify the dimensions of the rift as long as it is 

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice over 5, the rift can be 80ft longer.

**Global**: The rift can be up to 2 miles long, 200ft wide and 400ft deep.

|Duration|1 hour (1 day)|5(26)
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1(25)

|Save|CHA|

**Description**: The caster wards the target, granting it the toughness of stone. The target gains:
- Immunity to: "slashing", "sheer", "piercing" and "percussive" damage.
- Resistance to: "pressure" and "poison" damage.
- Immunity to: "bleed" and "cripple".
- Resistance to: "poisoned".

**Upcast**: For every MP die above 5, the duration increases by 1 hour.

|Limitation|A fiend will not willingly allow itself to be summoned by a divine, an nor can it be summoned to location that has a "divine" alignment of is otherwise consecrated.|-2
|Concentration|local|
|Save|-|

**Description**: Summons a fiend of 7th level or lower, that will faithfully serve, or fight for the caster. The caster and fiend are able to communicate through this spell (this is moot as fiends can generally understand the thoughts of humanoids). 

**Special**:
- You can only have one summon at any one time.
- The summon appears at the start of the caster's *next* turn.

**Limitation**: A fiend will not be willingly summoned by an entity aligned to the "divine". In this case a caster makes a contested Cha roll vs the fiend. If the fiend wins, it can chose to refuse the summons or to accept it, although in this case it is in no way under the caster's control and is likely to attack it.

**Upcast**: For every MP die above 5 added (4MP dice for global), the fiend's level can be increased by two.

**Global**: The spell does not require concentration. Furthermore the spell can be cast in two ways globally:
1. Like the "local" casting of the spell, but it lasts for a 1 week.
2. The fiend is summoned to perform a single task, or favour, which may last any amount of time. However, the fiend will demand some kind of reward in exchange (eg, the sacrifice of an unwilling humanoid, the desecration of a holy site, an evil deed that will blacken the soul of the one performing it).

**Description**: Chill the target, freezing it. The target takes 3d8 damage at the start of each turn and is "immobilised". This is negated by a successful CON save, which ends the spell. Furthermore, water within 10ft of the target freezes, and the temperature in the area of effect falls to "Extreme Temperature: Cold".

**Upcast**: The spell is permanent. Furthermore, when the target's HP reaches 0, the spell does not deal further damage.

|Limitation|An entity can be under the effect of only one "fairy feast" at a time|-2
|Save|Wis|

**Description**: The caster invites a host of fey for a feast.

A fey realm asserts itself in a 120ft radius of the point where the spell was cast, complete with ephemerally summoned fey, music, and a wondrous feast, which is sufficient to provide 101 medium, 47 large, or 9 larger entities with a day's nutrients. Regardless of type or race, suitable nutrients can be found. Any effects of starvation, dehydration and "insomnia" are cured. Likewise each entity gains immunity to either "charmed" or "frightened", as it chooses. The immunity lasts for 24 hours.

Collectively, the fey offer one piece of useful knowledge between them, and should violence or other danger erupt before the spell ends, disappear, along with the feast. In this case, the offered memory (if any) is not consumed, and the beneficial effects of the feast are not gained.

**Special**: If the caster offers up a precious memory (resulting in the loss of 1 rank in a skill of the caster's choice), the MP dice cost of the spell is removed. In addition, each entity that partakes in the feast can gain TWO of the below benefits, which it retains for 7 days:
- Immunity to "grappled", "prone", "restrained", "immobilised".
- Immune to "diseased" and "poisoned", and "necrotic" and "poison" damage.
- Immunity to "crippled", "incapacitated", "bleeding"
- Immunity to "paralysed" and "stunned".
- Immunity to "aphonic", "deafened", "blinded", "inaudible".
- Complete restoration of MP and SP (but not dice).
- Advantage on rolls pertaining to one skill.
- Advantage on saves to stabilise when "dying" or on ONE other type of save.
- Advantage on rolls pertaining to one skill.
- Advantage on initiative.
- Resistance to all physical damage types.

|Limitation|Only affects entities with a physical form|
|Limitation|The spell has no effect on "profane" entities, or those aligned with "air" or "fire"|
|Components|incantation, kinetic|
|Save|CHA|

**Description**: The caster manipulates the elements of earth or water (depending on the school used to learn the spell), to create a body part or earth or ice, functionally and visually indistinguishable from the original. The target is cured of the crippled condition and also immune to it for the duration of the spell. The entity likewise regains 1SP (but no SP dice) at the start of its turn if its total SP is below its total SP dice count for the duration of the spell.

When the spell ends, the body part crumbles to dust or melts into a puddle.

**Limitation**: 
- Only affects entities with a physical form.
- The spell has no effect on "profane" entities or those aligned with "air" or "fire".

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 6, an extra body part can be restored.

### Forced Possession

|Duration|1 hour (permanent)|
|Components|incantation, kinetic|

|Material|A red thread|
|Limitation|The caster must have a soul|
|Limitation|The target must be a corporeal mortal or construct|
|Condition|[Possessed](10-conditions-types.md#possessed)|
|Save|WIS + CHA|

**Description**: The caster projects their soul into another vessel and forcefully take [possession](10-conditions-types.md#possessed) of it. The target must succeed a WIS save, or the caster's soul leaves its body and enters the host. The caster falls unconscious. The target must then succeed a CHA save at the start of their turn or be possessed by the caster, with the caster's soul as the active soul in the target's body. If this save succeeds, the caster can choose whether their soul returns to their body, ending the spell, or whether it lingers in the target's body as an inactive soul. If the target has no soul, the caster automatically takes possession of the body as the active soul.

On successfully assuming control, the caster may immediately choose to send the target's soul back into their own body, hence causing the caster's body to be possessed by the target's soul (essentially this is a forced exchange of souls).

**Special**:
- If the level of foreign souls possessing the target's body exceeds twice the target's, the target loses 1 SP die at the start of each hour. If it has 0 SP dice, it instead takes 1 HP damage.
- If the possessed entity's soul is still in its body and the possessing soul aids the possessed's "nemesis", harms the possessed's "sworn ally", or harms the possessed, the possessed may make a CHA save at advantage to break the spell.
- Dealing "light[supernatural]", "divine" or "entropic" damage to the possessed body drives out the foreign souls, but does not return the original soul if it has left.
- The possessed body uses its own physical stats ([STR], [DEX], [CON]) and natural movement modalities and speed, but the possessing entity's mental stats ([INT], [WIS], [CHA]), abilities, skills and proficiencies.

**Global**: The spell does not require concentration and is essentially permanent. However, the target may make a CHA save at the end of each week to attempt to regain control of its body. The possession can still be ended using normal means.

|Material|A brass bowl filled with earth, the bowl crumbles when the spell is cast|-2
|Save|CON,CHA|

**Description**: The spell creates a solid, physical barrier of stone 5ft thick, around the caster with a radius of **up to** x feet. Dealing physical damage to the barrier (HiT=12, HP=20, damage reduction(except "esoteric")=20) in one turn opens a window big enough for a small size entity to enter freely, (or a medium entity to squeeze through). At the end of the turn, the barrier resets. Every time the barrier is damaged, contacted or crossed, the caster is aware of this, as well as the size and type of any entity crossing. Effects caused by area of effect "earth" spells of an equal or lower level that do not require an attack roll are excluded from the spell's area of effect.

In addition, the caster can designate any number of entities as "protected". These can meld through the barrier as a move action. In addition:
- All "protected" entities in contact with the ground gain +20ft to their movement speed.
- Any "unprotected" entity that attempts to cross the barrier must succeed a CON save or become "poisoned".
- Any "unprotected" entity in contact with the ground treats the area within the barrier as "[Difficult Terrain](#difficult-terrain)".

**Special**:
- If the attack is a rectilinear effect and the barrier crosses its path, the target is affected as if it is inside the barrier.
- Any entities aligned with "earth" can only enter (or leave) the area if they succeed a CHA save.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 6 placed in the spell, the radius increases by 10ft, or the duration increases by 1h.

**Global**: This is one of the greater barrier spells. Cast globally it extends over a radius of 1200ft, centered on a square/point and lasts for a month. For every 4MP dice above 24, either the duration increases by a week or the radius increases by 300ft.

|Save|Str,Cha|

**Description**: The caster calls the spirits of the winds to shroud them in storm. All space within **up to** 60ft of the chosen point is enveloped in violent wind spirits, that bring with them extreme winds.

Ranged weapons attacks against entities inside the spell (including thrown objects and entities) by weapons of size category "medium" and smaller automatically miss. Other ranged weapon attacks attacks are made at disadvantage. Weapon attacks that traverse the area of the spell are affected in the same way. The spell causes all noxious gases and airborne particles to dissipate, nullifying the their effect in the area of the spell.

Furthermore the caster specifies any number of entities as "protected" at the casting of the spell. This determines how other aspects of the spell interact with them.
- All unprotected targets that try to enter the area of effect of the spell (or are in the area when the spell first activates) must succeed on a STR save or be flung 50ft outwards from the point of contact, and suffer 3d12 sheer damage.
- All unprotected entities (and structures) in the warded area are at the start of their turn, must succeed on a STR save take 3d12 sheer damage (half on failure).
- All unprotected entities treat the area as "[Difficult Terrain](#difficult-terrain)", and flying entities are affected as by [extreme wind](#flying-and-turbulence).
- All protected entities have resistance to damage from ranged weapons, to pressure damage and lighting damage.
- Effects caused by area of effect "air"/"wind" spells of an equal or lower level that do not require an attack roll are excluded from the spell's area of effect. 

**Special**:
- If the spell is cast as a reaction, it cannot be upcast, and lasts for 1 minute.
- If the attack is a rectilinear effect and the barrier crosses its path, the target is affected as if it is inside the barrier.
- Any entities aligned with "earth" can only enter (or leave) the area if they succeed a CHA save.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 6 placed in the spell, the radius increases by 10ft, or the duration increases by 1h. If the spell is cast as a reaction, it cannot be upcast.

**Global**: This is one of the greater barrier spells. Cast globally it extends over a radius of 1200ft, centered on a square/point and lasts for a month. For every 4MP dice above 24, either the duration increases by a week or the radius increases by 300ft.

**Description**: At a point of their choosing within range, the caster creates an aqueous shell with a radius of **up to** 40ft that is criss-crossed by undulating watery tendrils that interact with entities within the barrier. As the spell is cast, the caster specifies any number of entities as "protected".

The spell affects protected entities within its area as follows:
- All "protected" entities within the barrier have resistance to physical, fire, and necrotic damage.
- All "protected" entities within the barrier have "light cover".
- Any "protected" entity that is "poisoned" is cured of the condition.
- Any "protected" entity that is "diseased"[natural] is cured of the condition if it remains in the area until the spell ends.
- If a "protected" entity is on fire, the fire is extinguished.

The spell affects unprotected entities within its area as follows:
- When attempting to enter the area, the entity must succeed a [CON] save or be "immobilised".
- When in the area, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and treats the area as "[Difficult Terrain](#difficult-terrain)".

**Special**:
- Any entities aligned with "fire" can only enter (or leave) the area if they succeed a CHA save.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 6 placed in the spell, the radius increases by 10ft, or the duration increases by 1h.

**Global**: This is one of the greater barrier spells. Cast globally it extends over a radius of 800ft, centered on a square/point and lasts for a month. For every 4MP dice above 24, either the duration increases by a week or the radius increases by 200ft.

Unlike the local casting, entities that are "diseased"[natural] that enter the area are cured after remaining there for an hour. Likewise, an entity immobilised by attempting to enter the spell's area is immobilised until the spell ends and does not make repeated saves against the effect (although the effect can be cured).

### Inner Voice

|Duration|12 minutes|+3
|Components|kinetic|
|Focus|A crystal of fluorite or quartz|
|Save|Wis|

**Description**: The caster bestows telepathy upon a target, allowing them to communicate clearly through thought alone with any sentient entity within 120ft. The target can also attempt to read surface thoughts of nearby entities, taking a full round action for one target with a successful observe roll of 20 or above. An entity can identify the effect with a spellcraft roll equal to the caster's threshold, in which case they can chose to block the reading of surface thoughts.

**Special**: 
- Trying to communicate in this way with entities with an INT score 12 points or more higher than their own triggers an INT save vs the INT based threshold  of the entity. On a failure the one under the effect of "Inner Voice" becomes catatonic for the duration of the spell.
- Trying to communicate in this way with entities with a CHA score 12 points or more higher than their own triggers a CHA save vs the CHA based threshold of the entity. On a failure the one under the effect of "Inner Voice" becomes "charmed" by the entity for the duration of the spell.
- All non-divine entities trying to communicate with **Glitches** or **Divines** in this matter are affected by both clauses. 

**Limitation**: The reading of surface thoughts for an entity takes a full round action. However, surface thoughts can change quickly from moment to moment, so it is be necessary to continuously read during a conversation to get anything other than snippets for most entities.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 6 used in the casting of the spell, either its radius increases by 20ft, or the duration increases by 12 minutes.

### Legion of Dead

|Limitation|You must have corpse of an animal or humanoid the appropriate size|-2(-1)
|Concentration|Yes(No)|
|Save|-|

**Description**: A form of pact magic: All corpses of huge or smaller ("huge") within 50ft of the offering (the offering must be within 30ft of the caster) and which are satisfied with the offering (see "special") are animated and become level III corporeal undead. The undead is capable of performing any reflexive or rote task it knew in life, if its body still supports that functionality. 

The undead faithfully follow **the single, initial command** that the caster makes, however the spirits animating the corpses retain their original allegiances. If the command is **completely** fulfilled by the end of the duration of the spell, the animated dead crumble to dust.

If the undead are not destroyed by the end of the spell, or the caster loses concentration, the caster's control of the legion ends. The dead do not return to rest, but become hostile towards all living things. However, these undead will prioritise those groups that they were hostile to in life over other living beings.

**Special**: 
- The offering must include firstly, something of symbolic significance to the dead (eg, their favourite dolfie, the banner of their religion, etc). If dead of multiple allegiances are present in the radius, only those that find the offering significant will be raised.
- If a command is given that would go against this, the caster loses control of all the dead animated by this spell. For example, animating a group of holy knights with this spell and ordering one of them to burn down their old shrine will not only lead to the command not being followed, but to the loss of control over all the dead animated in this way.

**Upcast**: For every MP die above 6 added (4 MP dice for global), the radius of the effect increases by 15ft.

**Global**: The spell has a radius of 1000ft and the duration is 1 week. For every 4 MP dice extra, the radius increases by 300ft. The spell does not require concentration is, **but** the caster cannot cast the spell again as a global spell for a week.

**Notes**: This spell produces a large number of units, possibly in the thousands. It is recommended that the DM controls the legion and uses it as a single group or AoE rather than individually rolling for each undead.

|Components|Kinetic|
|Limitation|The targets must be able to see the caster to be affected|-2
|Concentration|local|-3
|Save|WIS|

**Description**: The caster inflames the minds of their targets that do not succeed a WIS saving throw. Firstly the target entities are charmed by the caster, secondly they are seized by a fierce madness. At the start of its turn (after rolling the save), the target rolls a d6. This determines its further behaviour as follows:

1. Attack the nearest target (within 60ft of itself) with the intent to kill (if this is the caster, they do nothing instead).
2. Protect the nearest target (within 60ft of itself) to the best of its ability (using manoeuvres and abilities such as "intercept"/"deflect").
3. Approach the caster to the best of their ability.
4. Flee the caster to the best of their ability.
5. Cast a random spell of the highest level they know, on the nearest valid target (if not a spellcaster, does nothing).
6. Prostrate themselves while shouting gibberish.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice in the spell above 6, the radius increases by 10ft, or the spell lasts for an extra 12 minutes.

**Global**: The spell lasts for 1 day and affects all targets within a radius of 1000ft. For every extra 4 MP dice placed into the spell, the spell either lasts for an extra day or the radius increases by 200ft.

### Metamorphosis/Rebirth
|Name|Metamorphosis/Rebirth [Nature, Curse, Divine]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|6 (12)|
|Target(s)|1 mortal|
|Casting time|"full round action" (6 hours)|-2
|Range|15ft|
|Duration|1 day|+12
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1
|Focus|Ouroboros or an empty cocoon|
|Material|The body of the target|
|Limitation|Special (See below)|
|Save|Wis|

**Description**: The caster plants the seeds of change in the body and soul of a dying or doomed mortal, or one that has died less than 7 rounds ago. If the entity dies before healing any HP, or if it is already dead, the spell consumes its remains and it is revived as a mortal of a race other than the one it was previously. This is determined at random by rolling 2d12 and comparing the result with the "Metamorphosis Table" (see below).

Regardless of the state of the target when it died, it begins with half of its HP, half of its SP, half of its MP and half of the corresponding dice.

After 24 hours have passed, the life force from the consumption of the old body runs out and the target dies for good.

**Special**:
- A target never revives as a plant or monster. Because we do not want a repeat of treeridice.
- If the target is unwilling, it may attempt a WIS save vs the caster. Upon success it is not subject to the spell. More precisely the spell ends in a catastrophic [cascade centred](07-magic-and-spellcasting.md#the-catastrophic-cascade) on the target's body.
- The target retains its level after metamorphosing. Thus if a normal level 5 humanoid character is metamorphosed into a dragon, it will be a level 5 dragon (ie little more than a hatchling). If the spell is made permanent, it is recommended that player and DM discuss and come to an agreement as to how many levels of the new creature and how mny of its old levels are retained.

**Global**: The spell can be cast globally in one of two modes.
- On a mortal that has been subject to a local casting of Metamorphosis, but has not yet wilted. This removes the time limit to their rebirth and they are considered "properly" alive as if they were a *bona fide* mortal of their new race. Thereafter the effect is not considered a spell and cannot be removed, although, of course, they can still die again. When the spell is used in this way, the target of the spell loses 1 ability for very 2 levels (minimum of 1) and 2 proficiencies from their ordeal. This cannot be regained in any way, save divine intervention.
- Grant a mortal deceased within the last 7 days the gift of true rebirth. They will be reborn in the next seven days as a newborn of their own race, and will mature at the normal rate for a member of that race. They retain the memories and 1 rank in 3 skills of their choice, but nothing else. They do, however, have the chance to live their life again.

**Metamorphosis table**: This table determines what one will metamorphose into. If using custom race templates, please replace the standard ones with your own (TODO). Reroll the inner dice on hitting your own race.

### Otherworld Step
|Name|Otherworld Step [Travel, Fire, Water, Air, Earth]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local(global)|
|MP Dice|6 (12)|
|Target(s)|7 entities (special)|+7/8/9
|Casting time|1 full round action (6 hours)|-2
|Range|close|
|Duration|Special| +3
|Components|kinetic OR incantation|
|Limitation|see below|
|Save|Wis|

**Description**: Grants up to 7 entities the ability to travel the voids and barriers that exist between realms, and reach the nearest otherworlds. Be they the nearest stars or the closest layers of the immaterial world (spirit realms, elemental planes, etc). An unwilling target may make a Wis save vs the caster's Threshold to end the spell upon themselves (hence negating the effects).

To travel, the target must move 5ft with a destination in mind. If the traveller moves 5ft with no destination in mind, they are transported to the nearest valid destination. If the traveller is unable to move 5ft, then the spell activates the moment they do and remains active until that moment. Any attempt to travel by any modality will result in an otherworld step being made.

No time is seen to pass from the perspective of the traveller during their journey. From the perspective of an observer in the realm of departure, the target is seen to freeze for a moment an then flicker out of existence. Likewise, on the realm of destination, it is seen to appear with very little happening in between. As such the "step" does not provoke attacks of opportunity from entities on either side.

The destination point on the otherworld is the equivalent point to the point you set off from. If you are travelling between planets this might be the same coordinate. If you are travelling between parallel worlds, it might be the same point. If you are travelling between metaphysical/spirit realms, it might be the point with the most similar meaning, purpose or significance.

For the sake of mechanics, this is a "cosmic speed" effect.


**Special**:
  - This spell may be taken with any type of spellcasting other than nature, however the kind of realm that the traveller may visit is limited by he school. Thus if taken with:
  - "Spellcasting: Fire", it may only be used to visit realms associated with fire/heat/summer.
  - "Spellcasting: Water", it may only be used to visit realms associated with water/spring/winter/autumn.
  - "Spellcasting: Earth", it may only be used to visit realms associated with earth/ground/summer/autumn.
  - "Spellcasting: Air", it may only be used to visit realms associated with air/winds/winter/spring.
  - "Spellcasting: Incantation", it can be used to travel to realms associated with sound and never to silent realms.
  - "Spellcasting: Kinetic", it can be used to travel to realms associated with motion and never to still realms.

**Upcast**: Add one more target per MP die above 6.

**Global**: Move everything, including all entities, within a 120ft radius to the realm of choice (picking from a valid adjacent otherworld). For every 4MP dice above the usual, the radius increases by 40ft.

**Extra Notes:** The term "nearest otherworlds" only has meaning in cosmologies where other realms, planes and worlds can be sorted by distance from the "main", "home" or "material" world. For example:
- If the game world has star systems, then perhaps this spell might only allow travel to the nearest planets.
- If the game world has a "Berserk" style layered spirit world, then this spell would only allow travel to one layer at a time.
- If we are dealing with DnD style cosmology, then it would likely allow travel in steps such as "material plane"<->"ethereal plane"<->"elemental planes"<->"outer planes".
- If the game world has a more exotic cosmology, then it is for the DM and group to agree on a suitable interpretation.

**Description**: You summon a sharp burst of hurricane like wind that cuts through an area, dealing 5d12+[Sup] damage to all entities, objects and structures within it. Entities can avoid the damage with a successful Dex save. Even in this case all entities and objects of "huge" and smaller are blown back 20ft (for "medium").

**Upcast**: The size of the one increases by 15ft per MP die above 6 or the damage increases by 1d12.

|Duration|instantaneous|
|Components|incantation|-1
|Limitation|The spell only affects mortals and spirits|-2
|Save|-|

**Description**: The caster rebalances spiritual energies of willing entities within 30ft of it. Within the area of effect:
- The spell can add, or subtract, up to 6 MP dice to, or from, each willing entity's MP dice pool.
- The spell conserves the MP dice count between entities (for each die taken away from one entity, one must be added to another).
  - So if the caster rebalances MP dice between Suzy and Dave, and moves 6 MP dice to Dave's dice pool, Suzy must lose 6 MP dice.
  - In a bigger example with Suzy, Lucy and Dave, if the caster moves 6 MP dice to Dave's dice pool, she can do it by moving 6 MP dice from either Lucy or Suzy, or by moving (for example) 2 MP dice from her from Suzy's and 4 MP dice from Lucy's dice pools. The caster can also move MP from, or to, their own dice pool.
- For every MP dice drained, an entity loses 1d4+1 MP. For every MP dice restored, an entity gains 1d4+1 MP.

**Special**: The caster can forgo the MP dice cost of the spell by spending 3 HP instead.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice used above 6, the caster can add/subtract an extra MP die per entity.

|Limitation|An angel cannot be summoned by one who its god does not approve of, or by one who acts/stands against the concept it personifies|-2
|Concentration|local|
|Save|-|

**Description**: Summons an [angel](10-conditions-types.md#divine) of 8th level or lower, that will faithfully serve, or fight for the caster. The caster and angel are able to communicate (angels understand all languages anyway). 

**Special**:
- You can only have one summon at any one time.
- The summon appears at the start of the caster's *next* turn.

**Limitation**: An angel cannot be summoned by one who its god does not approve of, and nor by one who acts/stands against the concept it personifies. In this case, the god may decide to send the angel at a time of its choosing anyway, but with the purpose of punishing/opposing the caster who attempted to summon it. In this case, a divine mark of the god appears on the hand or face of the caster, and a threshold=20 ["Knowledge: Religion"](05-skills.md#knowledge) roll is able to identify it as such.

**Upcast**: For every MP die above 6 (4MP dice for global), the angel's level can be increased by two.

**Global**: The spell does not require concentration. Furthermore the spell can be cast in three ways globally:
1. Like the "local" casting of the spell, but it lasts for a 1 week.
2. An angel can be summoned to bear witness to an oath or an event. Since angels are eternal and do not lie, an event that took place under the watch of an angel is considered beyond doubt.
3. An angel can be called to become the "guardian angel" of a mortal who aligns with a concept or what a god stands for. The angel leaves a divine mark upon said mortal (recognisable with a threshold=24 "Knowledge: Religion" roll) and returns to its realm. The next three times that an attack or other event (other than HP loss caused by the ["dying" or "doomed"](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail) conditions) would outright kill the "guarded" mortal, it instead reduces their HP to 1.

|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1
|Material|Special (see below)|
|Limitation|Special (see below)|-4
|Save|CHA|

**Description**: Summon a level VIII "elemental" of an element corresponding to the element to faithfully serve and fight for you. The spirit can communicate with its summoner and other entities it would normally be able to communicate with. Elementals are often intelligent enough to understand the gestures and movements of mortals, but seldom understand their emotions and intentions.

**Limitation**:
- The elemental summoned corresponds to the spellcasting type, thus if the spell is cast with "Spellcasting: Elemental(Fire)", the elemental will be of type "fire".
- If the caster is aligned to the element opposite to the element of the elemental, it makes a CHA save vs the caster. On success it breaks free of the caster's control and becomes hostile to the caster and their allies.
- This spell can be cast with "Spellcasting: Nature", however, in this case the elemental is level VI instead of level VIII, and one can only summon elementals from their element. More precisely:
  - For a water elemental the caster needs a stream, pond, lake or sea.
  - For a fire elemental the caster needs a fire of at least medium size.
  - For an ear elemental, the caster needs at least 4 squares (10ft x 10ft) unworked earth.
  - For an air elemental, the cast needs an open sky.

**Special**:
- The material component for the spell is as follows:
  - Air: A handful of poplar fluff.
  - Earth: An offering of fine alcohol or 1HP worth of blood.
  - Fire: A saucer of lamp oil or a lump of coal.
  - Water: A sprinkle of bluestone.
- You can only have one summon at any one time.
- The summon appears at the start of the caster's *next* turn.

**Upcast**: For every MP dice added above 6, the elemental gains two levels.

**Global**: The elemental is bound for 1 day for every 8MP dice used summon it (minimum of 3 days), it *also* ga

|Target(s)|2 points the caster knows|
|Casting time|7 hours|
|Range|The realm|+30
|Duration|-|
|Components|incantation|+1
|Limitation|Special|-6

**Description**: The caster instantly creates a "[secret path](03-movement-exploration.md#secret-paths)" between the current location and another location in this realm or an adjacent realm. The path's destination must be one that the caster has previously visited. The caster knows the secret path and can find and follow it. They can share this information with other entities they can communicate with. Travelling this secret path takes 6 rounds.

**Special**: The secret path exists for a number of years equal to the caster's character level. However, other entities may end up finding and using or inhabiting this path. Every year there is a 1/6 chance that the path will shift and its location and route are no longer known to the caster.

**Limitation**: 
- If "Secret Path" is learned through "air", "earth", "fire" or "water" magic, it can only be cast if at least one of the locations it connects is associated with the element, or its season. 
- If "Secret Path" is cast through "nature" magic, it cannot connect two locales created through artifice (eg, cities, castles, houses, ships, etc).
- The secret path MUST be between two areas in the same realm, or between adjacent realms (eg, one can trace a path between the material realm and a shallow layer of the spirit realm, or a shallow and intermediate layer of the spirit realm, but not between material realm and intermediate or deep layer of the spirit realm).

|Duration|8 hours (1 month)|+9(28)

|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1(26)
|Save||

**Description**: The caster affects the weather, shifting any and all of, visibility, precipitation, wind and temperature by two points in either direction. For example if it is an average spring day with no wind and no rain and good visibility, the caster can change the weather between "extreme wind" or "no wind", in addition it can affect other aspects, eg "extreme wind, extreme rain, extreme (no visibility)". This use of the spell cannot break seasonal/climate rules (eg, summer snowstorms on warm plains).

Alternatively the caster can use the spell to affect only one aspect of the weather and move it in any direction, regardless of climate or season, such as changing extreme heat (even in a desert) into extreme cold.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 7, the spell lasts for an extra hour or increases in radius by 20ft.

**Global**: As local, but with a radius of 1200ft and a duration of 1 month. For every extra 4MP dice, the radius increases by 600ft or the duration increases by 1 month.

Cast globally this is greater magic that can bring calamity to a land where it is cast, destroying crops, turning a growing season to drought, saturation hill sides with water and snow at the worst possible time. Likewise it can bring salvation.

### Incarnate
|Name|Incarnate [Divine, Profane]|

|Target(s)|1 entity|
|Casting time|24 hours|-3
|Range|close|
|Duration|1 week|+6
|Components|incantation, kinetic|
|Focus|A symbol associated with the being|-1
|Material|Offering associated with the being|-2
|Material|A humanoid who is both unconscious and dying as a vessel|-2
|Limitation|See below| -4
|Save|Special|

**Description**: The caster performs a ritual, incarnating the residual energy of an incorporeal being that has previously been destroyed into a humanoid vessel. The entity retains all of its powers and MP/MP dice as well as skills, abilities, WIS, INT and CHA. It also uses the HP and MP/SP dice of the vessel. The vessel must be a humanoid that is ["unconscious"](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail) for the whole of the ritual, and ["dying"](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail) during the last round.

When the ritual is complete, the entity takes full control of the mortal vessel and controls it fully as if it was its own. It cannot leave the body it possess until the body is destroyed (reaches minus its HP total) or the spell ends.

The possessing entity is in no way beholden to the caster, but may be inclined to reward them.

When the spell ends one of the following things can happen (the final decision is with the possessing entity):
1. The possessing entity consumes the humanoid body it is possessing and is returned to the spirit realm or its divine/profane realm. The humanoid soul is consigned to the afterlife.
2. The possessing entity allows the humanoid soul to return to the body (hence allowing the sacrifice to live), and is itself consigned to the void.
3. The caster recasts the ritual and provides a new sacrifice. The possessing entity can chose whether to keep using the old body or the new one. Whichever body is discarded, the corresponding body is destroyed and the soul passes to the afterlife.


**Limitations**:
- The entity must be a "spirit" (deceased mortals are usually considered "spirits" for this purpose), "divine" or a "fiend".
- The entity must have a dice total (MP + SP) no more than three times the dice total of the caster.
- The entity is not beholden to the caster and it is not obliged to obey the caster, although it may if it is so inclined.
- The target entity is aware of who is trying return it and may attempt to resist. In this case the caster may disengage fom the ritual or try to force it. If the caster tries to force the issue, the target and caster make an opposed SAP roll. If the caster wins the ritual succeeds (although the caster may wish that it hadn't). If the ritual fails, the spell fails [catastrophically](07-magic-and-spellcasting.md#the-catastrophic-cascade) as if the spell was countered on the caster's location.
- The spell can NEVER be cast on the same target more than once.
- Unlike ordinary possession, "light[supernatural]", "divine" or "entropic" damage do nothing to drive the possessing soul out of the body.

**Upcast**: For each 8MP dice put into the spell, the target stays in the mortal realm for an extra week.

### Memory Thief

|Focus|A rusted chain|-1(34)
|Material|A gem (see below)|-4(30)
|Limitation|If the gem is broken, the spell ends|-2(28)
|Save|INT (special)|

**Description**: The caster speaks an ancient word of power and attempts to steal a memory, skill, spell, or proficiency from a target, robbing them of the ability to use it and taking it for themselves.

The target must make 2 intelligence saves. One immediately, and one after ten rounds (1 minute). If it succeeds the first save, the spell fails. Otherwise the memory is in limbo between the caster of the spell and the target and they both share it and have simultaneous access to it. If the target fails the second spell, the memory is stolen permanently.

If the gem is given to another being within an hour of casting, that being becomes the recipient of the memory, instead of the caster.

*This spell is a curse*.

**Special**: The [material level](12-equipment-economy.md#material-level) of the gem depends on the memory being stolen.
- Semi precious gem: An everyday memory, a skill with 4 ranks or fewer, a spell of 4th level (4MP dice) or lower. Any proficiency.
- True gem: A precious memory (memory of a loved one or a special moment), a skill with 7 ranks or lower, a spell of 7th level or lower. Any proficiency.
- A true gem of "spirit", "profane" or "divine" source: A sacred memory (most precious moments), any skill, any spell. Any proficiency.

**Limitation**: If the gem is broken, the spell ends.
- When the spell ends, the memory returns to its original owner, unless they are dead/destroyed.
- If the original owner of the memory is dead or destroyed, whoever breaks the gem keeps the memory as their own.
  - If the gem is destroyed by a soulless force, the memory settles in the nearest sapient being.

### Meteoric Flight
|Name|Meteoric Flight [Air, Fire, Travel]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|7 (14)|
|Target(s)|1 entity no larger than huge (20ft)|
|Casting time|1 main action (7 hours)|
|Range|close| -1
|Duration|1 minute (1 hour)|+1
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1
|Focus|The remains of a falling star, or a dragon's heart|-2
|Limitation|The turning circle|-1
|Limitation|Must use movement|-1
|Damage|2d8/4d8+[Sup] pressure|+6
|Save|WIS (harmless), Dex|

**Description**: The target gains a flight speed (poor) of its walking speed + 360ft (spell can be negated with a successful WIS save). During this time it MUST take at a "move" or "run" action every round. When the target lands, it deals 2d8+[Sup] damage to everything within 20ft, or 4d8+[Sup] if took the "run" action on the turn it landed. The target takes half of this damage. This damage is halved on a successful DEX save (the target of the spell does not get a save).

The target cannot be restrained or immobilised by any means other than a higher MP spell for the duration of the spell (but it can be killed, usually).

**Limitation**: [In accordance with flight rules](03-movement-exploration.md#flight), the turn radius of an entity using this spell is at least 600ft. This means that the uses of this spell are generally quite specific.

**Special**: 
- If the spell is dispelled mid-flight, the target maintains a horizontal speed of 400ft for the next minute, and deals damage as normal upon landing (unless other effects reduce its flight speed). However it also suffers from [the normal falling rules](03-movement-exploration.md#falling), which will probably be lethal.
- If the target is unable to take its move action for whatever reason (eg it is unconscious), it will continue to move along its previous trajectory (or in a random direction if it was previously motionless) until either the spell ends, or it hits a solid physical barrier.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 7 the movement speed increases by 100ft.

**Global**: The spell lasts for an hour and can affect up to 4 targets.

|Components|kinetic|-1
|Limitation (global)|The start and end location must be touching the earth|-1
|Material|A lodestone|
|Concentration|local|
|Save|Cha|

**Description**: The caster causes a gaping portal, 40ft across to rise out of the earth. The portal connects to any point upon the same world that is on the same contiguous landmass (this includes landmasses connected under a body water) and within the range of the spell. For the duration of the spell, entities and objects can pass through the portals and instantly appear on the other end.

For the sake of mechanics, this is a "blink speed" effect.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 7 the range increases by 4000ft or the radius of the portal increases by 5ft.

**Global**: The range of the portal is not limited, as long as it is on the same realm. The caster must succeed on a "Knowledge: Geography" roll of an appropriate difficulty to know an appropriate route between point of departure and destination. On a fail, the actual destination may be off by up to 10 degrees per point of difference between the threshold and actual roll.

### Transform Mortal
|Name|Transformation Mortal [Curse, Mortal, Nature, Water]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|7 (14)|
|Target(s)|1 entity|
|Casting time|"main action" (7 hours + 20 minutes per 4MP)|
|Range|15ft|
|Duration|1h (1 week)|+6
|Limitation|Target must be a mortal|
|Components|kinetic|(6)
|Save|Wis|

**Description**: The target transforms into any ["mortal"](10-conditions-types.md#mortals) of its own level or lower. It replaces its character sheet with that of the entity it transforms into, although it retains its own equipment and memories. An unwilling target can attempt a WIS save to negate the effects of the spell. On a success the spell does not occur.

**Special**:
- Shapeshifters can ignore the effects of this spell.
- The target, if it fails the initial save, does not get another chance to save.
- If the target is not at full HP/SP/MP/SP dice/MP dice, subtract the missing amount from the maximum value of the new form. If the starting total for HP/SP/MP/SP dice/MP dice is below 1, it is set to 1 instead.

**Limitation**: The caster can specify the appearance of what the target transforms into, but cannot specify a specific individual of a certain race. For example the following three are valid (assuming that you are familiar with them):
- "I transform into a ginger tabby cat with purple eyes".
- "I transform into an elf that looks exactly like Mallos Nuora."
- 'I transform into a red dragon."

While the following are not:
- "I want to transform into the witch's cat familiar, Ginger."
- "I want to transform into Mallos Nuora."
- "I want to transform into the dragon, Argargargior the Great."

Thus when this spell is used, the DM and player (but mostly the DM) pick out an appropriate stat block to use. Certainly in most (or all cases) this spell does not give a player access to the DM's NPC stat blocks.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 7 spend, the caster can either extend the spell by an extra hour, select an additional target, or increase the maximum level of the resulting mortal by 1.

**Global**: The spell lasts for a week. For every 4MP the spell lasts an extra week and the maximum level of the resulting mortal increases by 1. It cannot be cancelled voluntarily.

|Focus|- (a cup of clean meltwater, a handful of black earth, a bottle of spring air, a burning candle of wax gathered in summer)|
|Material|- (1HP worth of the creator's blood)|-2
|Save|CHA|

**Description**: The spell functions like "[Lesser Domain](#lesser-domain)", but lasts longer and affects a greater space. It also has the following differences:
- The greater domain may be populated with ephemeral spirits that typically take the forms of plants and animals. They are neither hostile nor friendly, and flee the domain if events threaten their existence.
- The caster can reshape the domain by will alone, changing 10ft x 10ft x 10ft of the domain per round.
- Spells associated with the element used to cast the spell have their cost decreased by 1 MP dice. This effect never stacks.
- Uninvited entities have disadvantage on rolls made to find or enter the domain.

**Limitation**: A caster must have at least 1 level in all 4 elemental spellcasting abilities in order to be able to use this spell safely. If the caster does not know all the elements, there is a chance of instead creating a shadow space inhabited by 4d8 hostile [Cursed Shades](monsters-npcs/profanes.md#cursed-shade-lesser). The probability is as follow: For 3 elements known, 25%. For 2, 50%. For 1, 75%.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 8, the spell lasts for an extra hour.

**Special**: A caster can only ever have ONE domain. If the spell is recast, the previous domain disappears.

**Global**: The spell lasts for 1 week. At the end of the week, the caster may decide at the end of this period whether to make the domain permanent.

The caster may instead *join* a domain onto an existing domain, hence expanding it. The domain must belong to the caster, or the creator of the other domain must permit it. In the case where the spell is used to expand a domain, the caster must make a "[Spellworking](05-skills.md#spellworking)" roll with a Threshold=[own threshold + 1 for every expansion that the domain has undergone]. Upon failure the spell ends in catastrophic failure.

|Save|CHA|

**Description**: The spell creates a grand seal within a 60ft radius of a point warding it against cosmic forces. This barrier has three effects within its area of effect while it is active:
- Everything in the AoE is immune to "[entropic damage](10-conditions-types.md#esoteric-damage)".
- All secret paths that start or end in the area of effect are unusable.
- An entity that wishes to enter or leave the area by "cosmic" or "blink" speed, or through the use of a spell or supernatural ability must succeed on a CHA sav vs the caster's Threshold, or fail. The save cannot be repeated.

**Limitation**: 
- If the spell is learned through "air", "earth", "fire" or "water" magic, it can only be cast if the location is associated with the element, or during the appropriate season.
- If the spell is cast through "nature" magic, it cannot be cast in locales created through artifice (eg, cities, castles, houses, ships, etc).

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 8 used in casting the spell, the duration increases by 8 hours, or the radius increases by 20ft.

**Global**: This is one of the great barrier spells used by great mages as part of a great defensive weave, be it to keep great calamities sealed through the ages, or protect places and being precious to them.

The spell covers an area of 1200ft and lasts for a year. For every extra 4 MP dice used, the radius increases by 400ft, or the duration increases by a year.

|Material|An item or mortal precious to the target|-2
|Limitation|spell fails if the target has a "divine" alignment| (-12)
|Save|Cha (special)|

**Description**: The caster performs an intricate ritual that binds the fate of a willing, mortal target to a profane being with the purpose of returning the target to life. In return, the profane being gains a grasp on the target's fate.

The spell can either be cast while the target is alive or within 6 days of its demise.

The spell allows the target to defy the laws of creation and return to life on the 6th day (midnight) after its death. If it had a physical form, then it is restored to how it was immediately before it died (minus the injuries). It returns to life with full HP, MP, SP and dice. However, it is forever changed:
- The target gains the "profane" alignment, which cannot be removed by any means, furthermore magical means of discerning entity type will detect the resurrected target as "profane[undead]". The resurrected target does not gain any of the traits associated with "profane" or "undead" entities. 
- The target loses its ability to reproduce, if it previously had the ability.
- Should the target go against the will or purpose of the profane being it is bound to, it suffers 3d6 profane damage with no save. The target always knows if it is about to go against the profane being it is bound to.
- Whenever the target is asleep, or, if it does not sleep, for the hour immediately after midnight, the profane has direct control of the target and will use this to further its goals (which are usually to oppose creation in some way).
- Should the target die, it rises again. This time, however, it loses its free will and becomes an undead thrall under the profane being's control.

Finally, the resurrected must sacrifice at least 1 level worth of mortals, of the same type as itself, every day (starting at midnight). Until it has done so, it is unable to regain MP, SP or HP.

**Limitation**:
- The spell fails if the target has a "divine" alignment.
- The spell fails if the target is unwilling.

**Special**: The target can break the profane pact with a successful CHA save. In this case it dies, and its soul returns to the afterlife. It can only attempt this save once. Furthermore, should it fail, it can never attempt the save again.

**Description**: The caster grants immense vitality. For the duration of the spell, every round as a secondary action, the target can either:
- Regain 1 HP if its current HP is below half of its HP total.
- Reconnect a severed body part, or restored a crippled (but not missing) body part.
- Cure "blinded", "deafened", "diseased", "poisoned", "bleeding", "paralysed" on itself, if the condition is caused by a damaged body part.

In addition the target can forgo these effects for a minute to regrow a body part.

If the target is unconscious, it regains 1 HP if its current HP is below half of its HP total.

**Limitation**: 
- Only affects entities with a physical form.
- The spell has no effect on "profane" entities.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 8, the spell lasts for an extra 12 minutes.

 ### Earthquake
|Name|Earthquake [Destruction, Earth]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|9 (36)|
|Target(s)|180ft radius around a point on the ground, (3600ft)|36
|Casting time|"1 full round action" (9 days)|-2(34)
|Range|240ft (1 mile)|+4(38)
|Duration|1 minute (1 hour)|+6(44)
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1(43)

|Material|An earthenware vessel, containing the Focus, which is broken when the spell is cast|-2(39)
|Concentration|local|-3(38)
|Damage|6d12 pressure damage|
|Save|STR, DEX|

**Description**: The caster triggers ripples deep with the earth, which bloom into terrible shaking which destroys structures and knock entities off their feet. In addition rifts open somewhat randomly in the area of effect. The effects in the area of effect are as follows:
- All entities using "walk" modality must succeed a DEX save at the start of their turn or fall prone.
- All entities using the "dig" modality must succeed a STR save at the start of their turn or take 6d12 damage and be "immobilised" (half damage on successful save).
- All structures take 6d12 points of damage at the start of the caster's turn, unless they are warded, in which case the caster must succeed on a SAT roll vs the threshold of the ward. Any entity inside a structure that collapses must succeed a DEX save and a STR save. If it fails the DEX save it also takes the 6d12 damage. If it fails the STR save it is "immobilised".
- 1d4 fissures open at points of the caster's choosing.The fissure's act as per the "[Rift](#rift)" spell, but end at the edge of the spell's area of effect. If the spell lasts for its full duration, the fissures have a 50% chance of closing, in which case any entities inside them must succeed a STR save or take 6d12 damage and be "immobilised" (half damage on successful save).

**Global**: The spell extends for a radius of 3600ft and lasts for an hour. The fissures open once per minute instead of once per round, and their location is random.

### Fairy Ball/Masquerade
|Name|Fairy Ball/Masquerade [Nature, Kinetic, Spirit]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|58 (41)
|MP Dice|9 (36)|
|Target(s)|60ft radius (1200ft)|12
|Casting time|1 action (9 hours)|
|Range|120ft|+3
|Duration|1 minute (24 hours)|+3
|Components|kinetic|
|Focus|A sprig of holly or a branch of fern|-1
|Material|special|-2
|Limitation|"Profane" entities do not gain any benefits of the spell|-2
|Healing|4d4+[Sup] SP and MP|+12
|Healing|4 conditions of choice|+12
|Save|WIS|

**Description**: The spell briefly sinks a part of the material realm into the fey realms, forcing the absurd rules of feydom to assert themselves in the spell's area of effect.

Firstly, all targets of the caster's choice regain 4d4+[Sup] MP and SP, if they are in the spell's area of effect when it is cast.

Secondly all targets of the caster's choice are cured of up to 4 conditions of their choice, if they are in the spell's area of effect when it is cast.

Thirdly, all hostile entities and all "[profane](10-conditions-types.md#profane)" must make a WIS save vs the caster's threshold, or gain the "glowing" condition, and be either "frightened" of, or "charmed" by, the caster and their allies for the duration of the spell (repeated saves apply). This effect occurs to entities if they are in the spell's area of effect when it is cast, or when they first enter the area of effect.

Fourthly, all willing allies are transformed into "beasts" or "fey" of the caster's choice, as if by the "[Transform Mortal](#transform-mortal)" spell. This effect occurs to entities if they are in the spell's area of effect when it is cast, or when they first enter the area of effect.

**Special**: If the caster sacrifices a precious memory, in the form of permanently losing one of their abilities, the MP dice cost of the spell becomes zero. In addition the following effects occur:
- The area of the spell is cut off from the material world (or other realms), and it is only possible to enter or leave via a secret path that the caster knows, or with a ["navigate"](05-skills.md#navigate) roll equal to the caster's threshold.
- Fey spirits take the form of entities of the caster's choice. These provide a ["deceive"](05-skills.md#deceive) roll equal to the caster's spell threshold, for the sake of targeting and identifying the caster for other purposes. If a successful "observe"/"sense motive" roll, or ["truesight"](06-abilities.md#truesight-i-v) (or a similar ability) do not reveal the true target, this counts as ["full concealment"](04-combat.md#cover-and-concealment).
- All spells with a spirit/spiritual/nature descriptor cost 1 MP dice less to cast (this does not stack), and gain +1 to their threshold. 

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 9, the spell radius increases by 20ft or the duration increases by 1 minute.

**Global**: The spell lasts for 24 hours and covers a radius of 1200ft. If the caster sacrifices a precious memory (and permanently loses an ability) there are a couple of extra effects (on top of the aforementioned special boons):
- All allies heal all conditions 1 hour after the start of the spell, all MP and SP 2 hours after the start of the spell, starvation, thirst and insomnia 3 hours after the start of the spell, and all HP at the end of the spell. SP and MP dice are not restored.
- Additional semi-illusionary changes to local terrain may occur.
- The fey will be willing to offer the caster up to one piece of secret information (either plot related, or secret knowledge (knowledge threshold=36)). Alternatively a fey being may be offered as a bride or groom to the caster by the ruler of the fey realm (although unions between mortals and spirits seldom end well..).
- This spell borders on legendary magic, that forever changes the locale where it is cast. When the 24 hours are over, three of the 8 effects caused by the "local" casting of the spell continue to be active for 108 years. Likewise, mortals born in this area tend to have a "spiritual" alignment and fey traits.

 ### Ifrit's Gift
|Name|Ifrit's Gift [Fire, Spirit, Summer]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|9 (36)|

|Limitation|Cannot be cast on a target that is aligned with water. Nor can the target be profane.|-2(16)
|Save|Cha|

**Description**: The caster implores the powers of the inner elemental realm of fire to grant its power to a single being. The target of the spell gains a halo of fire and the following properties:
- Immunity to fire and cold damage and the effects of extreme heat and cold. (8)
- A blink speed of 60ft.
- "[Life sense](06-abilities.md#life-sense-i-v)" to 120ft.
- Any hostile entities that succeed in a basic combat manoeuvre against the target take 3d8 fire damage.
- Flammable objects within 15ft of the target burst into flame (the target can suppress this effect).
- Weather conditions within 120ft of the target shift two points in the direction of extreme heat (the target can suppress the effect).
- The target deals 3d8 fire damage to any entity or object against which it makes a successful basic combat manoeuvre, or when it succeeds on a basic combat manoeuvre against a target.
- The target gains "Xenophonia:Spirits" and "Xenophonia:Elementals".
- The target gains +4 to "Knowledge:Religion" and "Knowledge:Arcana".
- Elementals[fire] will not willingly attack the target of the spell unless they are of level 17 or higher or they are summoned. Summoned elementals[fire] that attempt to attack the target of the spell must succeed on a CHA save vs the caster or lose the attack.

**Special**: If the spell is cast in the area of a [Greater Cosmic Seal](#greater-cosmic-seal), the caster must succeed on a CHA save vs the threshold of the seal or lose the spell.

**Global**: The spell lasts for a week. Furthermore, the radius of the weather effects increases to 2400ft. Lastly, the target of the spell may spend one or more days in prayer and meditation. For every day it does so, it may summon 15 levels of elementals[fire] (no single elemental may be of higher level than 15) that will serve them and fight for them faithfully until the spell ends. Any surviving elementals of level 10 and above turn on the target of the spell when it ends. The rest return to their realm.

### Mage's Oath
|Name|Mage's Oath [Incantation, Curse, Divine]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|9 (36)|
|Target(s)|Up to 9 willing targets|+8
|Casting time|"full round action" (9 days)|-1
|Range|close|
|Duration|1 day (permanent)|+24
|Components|incantation|+1(32)
|Focus|-|
|Material|1HP worth of blood (global: or one item precious to each participant)|-2
|Limitation|All participants must be willing|
|Save||

**Description**: The caster grants an oath sworn between up to 9 targets to gain real power. The words of the oath, specifically between the participants have the power of the laws of nature. This can also be used to replicate the effect of [Promise](#promise) or [Pact](#pact). Otherwise, the targets can:
1. Exchange or trade for free one or more of their abilities, boons, stats, skills, or even racial traits with other participants. When the spell ends the abilities are returned.
2. Lend or borrow, abilities, boons, stats, skills or racial traits with other participants. However, should one participant of the oath lose what is lent, it is lost by all. Thus if the caster lends his MP to an ally, the MP is *shared* between them, and when one of them loses MP, so does the other. This is especially poignant when HP is shared and lost. Likewise, should one member of the oath die, that which is lent is permanently lost by all.
3. Create a physical law binding one or more participants. However, if the law gives some kind of benefit, it must give an equal drawback, as determined by the DM. Likewise, if some kind of condition is involved, the fulfilment of this condition must be at least somewhat plausible.
  - For example, the oath may be "I will fear nothing while I'm with you", granting immunity to "frightened" in the presence of another participant. This would also imply that the one making the oath would *always* be "frightened" in their absence.
  - "I will not die until I have seen the sunset", may make one immortal, but it will guarantee death once the sunset is seen. Likewise if such an oath is made when seeing the sunset is literally impossible, the universe (read: the DM) MUST contrive an event that makes it instead inevitable, literally or figuratively. In this case, a blind paladin who swears such an oath may miraculously regain her sight in time to see the sunset, or see it in her dreams.
  - This use of the spell is incapable of changing the nature of the world, but is capable of changing the path its targets walk to their destiny, thus oaths such as "I will never be defeated till the world ends", would not affect when the world ends, but can perhaps carry the one making it to the moment the world ends, or [seal them](#slumber) in such a way that they are incapable of being defeated or attaining victories.

**Special**:
- All targets of the spell innately know that they are making a mage's oath when the spell is cast, and have the power to refuse to participate if they are willing.
- Dispelling a Mages's Oath means that all participants of the oath, and the one dispelling it, suffer the effects of the oath.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 9, the spell lasts an extra day.

**Global**: The effect is permanent until dispelled.

### True Storm
|Name|True Storm [Air, Destruction, Spring, Winter]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|

|Damage|4d8+[SUP] lightning/ice|12(51)
|Condition|Aphonia, Deaf, Blind, Prone/Restrained|6(57)
|Save|STR,CON,DEX|

**Description**: The caster summons a mightly storm that covers an area with a radius of 100ft. Extreme winds within the storm blind and deafen entities within it. The force of the wind likewise deals 3d12+[SUP] sheer damage to everything caught within it.

Ranged weapons attacks against entities inside the spell, those made across the area, or made by entities inside the spell, automatically miss. The spell causes all noxious gases and airborne particles to dissipate, nullifying the their effect in the area of the spell.

In addition the following effects apply inside the spell:
- All corporeal entities of size "Large" and smaller within the spell automatically count as restrained and are moved up to 50ft within the spell as the caster wishes. Larger entities may make a CON save to avoid the effect. In either case an entity thus affected may attempt a STR save at the start of its turn to break free. When it does, it is flung to outside the nearest edge of the spell, landing prone and taking 50ft sheer damage.
- All entities that are not restrained move at 1/4 speed within the spell's area of effect and flying entities are affected as by [extreme wind](#flying-and-turbulence).
- Upon entering the area of effect of the spell, all entities that do not succeed on a CON save are considered aphonic and blind until they leave the area.
- Every round the caster can choose an area with a column with a radius of 30ft within the spell for one of the following effects:
  - Lightning bolts strike the area, causing 4d8+[SUP] lightning damage to all entities in the area (DEX save half).
  - Temperatures plummet in the area, cauing 4d10+[SUP] cold damage to all entities in the area (CON save half).

**Upcast**: For every MP dice above 9, the radius of the spell increases by 50ft, or the lightning/ice damage increases by 3d8.

**Global**: The spell has a radius of 2000ft and a height of 1 mile. It lasts for 2 hours. Adding an extra 4MP dice increases the radius by 1000ft.

 ### Wave
|Name|Wave [Spring, Travel, Water, Winter]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|9 (36)|
|Target(s)|250ft x 150ft x 100ft (special)|+30
|Casting time|"1 full round action" (9 days)|-2(28)
|Range|240ft (1 mile)|+4(32)
|Duration|instantaneous (special)|
|Components|incantation,kinetic|-1(31)
|Save|STR|

**Description**: The caster summons a great mass of water (1.8 million cubic feet), that appears along a 250ft long straight line in range, rises to a height of 100ft and sweeps forwards 150ft before collapsing. This has the following effects:
- Objects weighting less than 10000lb are swept away to the end of the wave's range.
- All corporeal entities in range must succeed on a STR save or be swept 100ft along the path of the wave (to its end). Otherwise they are swept half of the distance. Entities of size large or smaller make the save at disadvantage.
- Entities that fail the STR [take 2d6 HP damage from suffocation](03-movement-exploration.md#characters-starvation-and-other-bad-ways-to-die). Entities that do not breath, or breath water are not affected.
- All structures take 8d12 pressure damage.
- At the end of the wave's range, all objects it carries are dropped and suffer 5d8 percussive damage from falling, landing prone unless unless they succeed on a DEX save.
- At the end of the wave's range the water spreads outwards at a speed of 200ft per round for the next 5 rounds. Entities caught in the area must succeed a STR save or be swept 200ft away, landing prone. Objects weighing 2000lb or less are swept away.

**Global**: The spell works in one of two ways.
- It creates a wave with a width of 5000ft, that travels a distance of 3000ft and has a height of 2000ft. This wave travels at a speed of 600ft per round. The STR save is repeated at the start of affected characters' turns. Drowning damage is applied every round when the save is failed. The falling damage at the end of the spell is 36d8.
- Alternatively, the wave has a width of 100ft, a height of 20ft and a length of 150ft. In this case, the wave lasts for 1 month and travels at a pace of up to 200ft per round over water in the direction specified by the caster, or at 40ft per round over land. It can carry objects of up to half of its volume without and causes no damage.

### Avatar
|Name|Avatar [Divine, Profane]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|10 (40)|
|Target(s)|1 entity|
|Casting time|2 full round actions (48 hours)|-3
|Range|close|-1
|Duration|1 minute (permanent)|+24
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1
|Focus|A symbol associated with the divinity|-1
|Material|A great sacrifice (perhaps a mortal of great purity and good for a deity associated with malice and destruction or a deed of self-sacrifice from a more noble deity, perhaps performed in the past)|-2
|Material|A suitable mortal or construct to serve as a vessel|-2
|Limitation|See below| -4
|Save|Special|

**Description**: The caster makes a transient link to a deep layer of divine realms and beseeches a powerful **"divinity"** (usually a god) to descend and inhabit a mortal (or construct) vessel, hence creating an avatar of the deity on the mortal realm. The vessel must be willing. If the vessel is unwilling and unconscious, it must make a Wis save with the threshold = the caster's SAP+Wis threshold. If the target is otherwise unwilling, the spell fails.

When the ritual is complete, the vessel is invigorated by the divine energy, restoring its MP, MP dice, SP and SP dice to full. At that moment the divinity takes full control of the mortal vessel and controls it fully as if it was its own (although either the DM or the player may control the avatar). The divinity uses its own stats, saves, abilities, skills, and attacks, but uses the HP, MP, SP (and dice) and effective level of the vessel. Thus it is limited, for example, in the number of MP or SP dice it may expend for a single ability or overall and the total MP/SP of the vessel.

The divinity is in no way beholden to the caster, but may be inclined to reward them or assist them. Likewise, the divinity can make a contested Cha roll vs the host and leave the avatar at any point it wishes, hence ending the spell.

No material form, mortal or construct, can withstand the stress of being a divine vessel. At the start of each of its turns, and every time the avatar takes a "main action" or "full round action", it loses 1HP of untyped damage. This damage cannot be reduced, negated or avoided in any way.

Furthermore, when the spell ends and/or the deity leaves the avatar the mortal/construct host must make a CON and WIS save against the **divinity's CHA based save threshold**.
- If it fails the CON save, each of its six stats (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha) are reduced by 2 permanently.
- If it fails the WIS save, it loses 9 proficiency points from up to 4 skills (chosen by dice roll, counting down from the first skill till the number of ranks is 0, and then moving to the next randomly chosen skill if it has lost less than 9 points in total so far). It also forgets 7 abilities.


**Limitations**:
- Divinities are often picky about who will serve as their vessel. A dark god often prefers a vessel that is innocent and "pure" that it may best damage and corrupt it, or it may prefer a powerful vessel that can be best used complete its schemes. A kind god may prefer a vessel on the brink of destruction, or one that has endured great hardships, or it may prefer a champion of its cause (This is usually for the DM to decide). A deity that is not satisfied by the offered vessel may decide to ignore the call or punish the one who calls it.
- The divinity is aware of who is calling upon it and decide to ignore the summons. In this case the caster may disengage fom the spell or try to force it. If the caster tries to force the issue, the target and caster make an opposed SAP roll. If the caster wins the spell succeeds (although the caster will likely wish that it hadn't). If the spell fails, it fails [catastrophically](07-magic-and-spellcasting.md#the-catastrophic-cascade) as if the spell was countered on the caster's location.
- Unlike ordinary possession, "light[supernatural]", "divine" or "entropic" damage do nothing to drive the possessing being out of the body offered up to it.

**Global**: The spell lasts for as long as the vessel inhabited by the deity is not destroyed and the deity wishes to remain in it (but at least a week). Likewise, the avatar only takes the unavoidable damage when it takes a "main action" or "full round action".

 ### Edict of Life
|Name|Edict of Life [Curse, Healing, Nature]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local(global)|
|MP Dice|10 (40)|
|Target(s)|1 (10 mile radius)|
|Casting time|1 main action (10 days)|
|Range|120ft (close)|
|Duration|1 day (instantaneous)|
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1
|Save|CON|

**Description**: The caster channels vital energies positively or negatively into its target.
- If channelled positively:
  - The target becomes immune to poison and disease for the duration of the spell.
  - The target becomes immune to "poisoned", "diseased", "catatonic", "bleeding", "paralysed" and "dying" (it becomes unconscious instead).
  - Once during the duration of the spell the target can regain all HP, SP and MP as a reaction. Alternatively, it can forgo regaining the SP and MP and be cured of all conditions affecting it instead. IIn either case, if it does this, the spell ends.
- If channelled negatively:
  - The target must succeed a CON save or suffer 5d6 entropic damage. In addition its SP and MP drops to zero. It also becomes "catatonic" for the duration of the spell (can make repeated saves at the start of its turn). On a successful save, the target does not not suffer the entropic damage, and loses only half of its SP and MP.
- Negative and positive channelling is reversed for undead.

**Global**: Globally this spell acts differently.
- If cast positively:
  - All mortals within 10 miles regain 6 HP, and are cured of one disease, one poison and one condition of their choice.
  - Infertile, barren, or contaminated land within range becomes fertile. Fertile land in range yields twice the harvest for the next 10 years.
  - The after-effects of "[Harvest](#harvest)" on the affected territory ends.
  - Each curse affecting the natural terrain within the area of effect ends if it was cast with less than 9 MP dice (if local), or 36 MP dice (if global). Likewise, all poisons affecting the land are neutralised.
- If cast negatively:
  - All mortals within 10 miles must make a CON save or lose 6 HP and become poisoned. For simplicity a DM may assume that 96% of level 1, 80% level 2, 36% of level 3, and 4% of level 4 mortals in the area of effect that are not directly relevant to the game die.
  - All lands territory within 10 miles becomes barren wasteland, incapable of supporting life. Crops wither. Forests begin to wilt and rot. Toxic plankton blooms in waters and wipes out fish stocks. Etc.

**Special**: When cast globally, Edict of Life is a legendary magic. It it either saturates the area of effect with natural energies, or depletes those energies.
- If cast positively:
  - An area affected by the spell positively is becomes aligned with "Nature" for the next thousand years. Mortals born in the area may be born with innate nature magic, xenophonia, an affinity for "track", "survival" or "harvest".
  - Friendly sprites may spontaneously come into existence, and talking animals and plants may be born in the area of effect for the next thousand years.
- If cast negatively:
  - An area affected by the spell becomes "cursed" until the curse is removed. Beasts are unwilling to enter this territory.
  - For the next thousand years beasts, monsters and humanoids born in this territory will be stillborn.
  - For the next thousand years, "profanes" are attracted to the affected area.

- Immunity to "[physical](10-conditions-types.md#physical-damage)" damage.
- Immunity to "grappled", "restrained" and "immobilised".
- +4 to acrobatics, fly and observe (as well as proficiency in the skills if not already proficient).
- A perfect fly speed of 120ft, or an increase to their existing fly speed and quality.
- An ability to blink up to 120ft as a secondary action.

**Special**: Gift of the Winds is a legendary magic. It channels the realm of the winds through those entities affected by the spell.
- Wind sprites may appear before those once targetted by the spell, or in places where they have stayed for at least 8 hours. These wind sprites are friendly to former targets of the spell.
- There is 1/6 chance that offspring of former targets of the spell are aligned to elemental air, and a 1/12 chance that instead of a mortal offspring, they will sire/birth a wind sprite.
- When a mortal once targetted by the spell dies, there is a 50% chance of its spirit becoming an air elemental.

**Global**: The spell lasts for a year. Furthermore instead of a "perfect" flight speed of 120ft, the targets obtain a "good" flight speed of 240ft.

|Save|Str,Dex,Con (Else no damage from tendrils)| -3(60)

**Description**: A crown of ice appears upon the caster's head(s) (if it has one or more). The caster takes control of all water within an 80ft radius with the following effects:
- All entities of the caster's choice gain the following for the duration of the spell:
  - A 30ft swim speed
  - Water walking
  - An alignment to [water]
  - Water breathing and the ability to communicate with all entities aligned to [water]
  - Immunity to "charmed" and "catatonic".
  - Heavy cover from blocks of ice or tendrils of water.
- As a "secondary action", the caster can freeze or melt any amount of water in the area of effect. Any entity caught in the frozen areas can attempt to break free with a Str save, however, this is often futile, as even if they break free, they may still be surrounded by walls of ice 10-20 feet thick. (This is very useful as a barrier)
- As an action call watery tendrils to strike any number of targets in the area of effect, dealing 4d12 percussive damage on a failed Dex save. If the caster so choses, the tendrils can throw a target up to 80ft (or move a willing target the same distance).
- As an action, cause (CON save to negate) or cure bleeding in any number of targets.
- Control the movement of water as a "move action", including:
  - Raising or lowering water levels at will.
  - Changing speed and flow of water in the area at will (but induing currents of no more than 240ft per round)
- Entities aligned with fire have disadvantage to all attacks in the area of effect, and saving throws against their abilities/spells/etc are made at advantage.
- The zone of effect moves with the caster, but at no more than 90ft per round.

**Special**: "Mandate of the Deep" is a legendary magic. It gifts a part of the material realm to the lords of the deep.
- All entities aligned with water have advantage against effects caused by the spell.
- If the area where the spell is cast is already claimed by another elemental lord of water, the caster forever gains their grudge.
- The spot where it is cast forever resonates with an aura of [spiritual, water] energies. Mortals born in those lands/seas might be aligned in some way with elemental water.
- Even after the spell has dissipated it leaves echoes behind, lesser elementals or supernatural mist may spontaneously spring up in the place it was cast for 108 years if it was cast locally and a millennium if it was cast globally.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 10, the radius of the spell increases by 15ft.

**Global**: The locale within 3/4 miles of the caster is sworn to the realm of water, and the caster is its regent. The spell acts as normal, with the exception that it has a radius of 3/4 of a mile.

|Concentration|local|-3(24)
|Damage|12d8+[Sup] fire|+39(63)
|Condition|Heavily concealed, Catatonic|+9(68)
|Save|Con, Cha|

**Description**: Flames bloom on flammable surfaces all around the caster and rise, tree-like, to a height of 160ft. This has the following effects:
- Everything within the flames in heavily concealed.
- All entities that first enter the area or first start their turn in it, must make a Cha save or become catatonic. The entity may retry the save at the end of each turn. Those that succeed are immune to the "catatonic" condition until the end of the spell.
- When an entity first enters the area on its turn, or starts its turn in the area, it makes a Con save or takes 10d8 fire damage. On a successful save it takes half damage. 

**Upcast**: For every extra MP die above 10, increase the radius by 10ft and height by 5ft or increase the damage by 2d8.

**Special**: The realm of flame is a legendary magic. It is the embodiment of flaming destruction.
- All entities aligned or immune to "fire" are immune to the "catatonic" effect caused by the spell.
- The spot where it is cast forever resonates with an aura of [spiritual, fire and destructive] energies. Mortals born in those lands might be aligned in some way with elemental flame.
- Even after the spell has dissipated it leaves echoes behind, "[Meadow of Flame](#meadow-of-flame)" or lesser elementals may spontaneously spring up in the place it was cast for 108 years if it was cast locally and a millennium if it was cast globally.

**Global**: Realises the Realm of Flame onto the caster's current location. The radius is 1 mile. For every extra 4MP the radius increases by 200ft and the height increases by 10ft and the damage increases by 2d8.

 ### True Geomancy
|Name|True Geomancy [Divine, Earth]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|10 (40)|
|Target(s)|80ft radius (1600ft radius)|
|Casting time|"1 full round action" (10 days)|-2
|Range|close|-1(-3)
|Duration|12 minutes (2 weeks)|+12(9)
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1(8)
|Damage|3d12 percussive/piercing/pressure|9(17)
|Conditions|Blinded, Grappled, Restrained, Immobilised|+14(31)
|Conditions|heavy cover|+4(35)
|Damage Reduction|20 physical, 10 fire/ice|+8(43)
|Damage Resistance|Lightning, Light|+12(55)
|Concentration|local|
|Focus|A an emerald statuette|-1(54)
|Material|An offering from the realm of stone|-2(52)
|Save|STR/DEX, CON|

**Description**: The caster gains brief access to a fragment of the powers of creation that shaped the earth, bending the earth to their will.
- Any number of entities that the caster designates gain damage reduction from physical damage (20) and damage reduction (10) from fire and cold damage, as the earth reshapes itself to protect them. Likewise, they gain heavy cover.
- All entities gain resistance to "light" and "lightning" damage.
- Secondly, as a main action, the caster can reshape up to 4 areas of earth, totalling 1000 (5ft x 5ft x 5ft) cubes of earth or rock as they wish. This can result in entities, falling or being trapped within earth or rock. The shapes created by this effect are always stable and solid. Nor can the thinnest portion be less than 5ft x 5ft.
  - Any entity on the edge of such a zone is "restrained" unless it succeeds a STR or DEX save (in which case it is pushed to the edge of the zone "grappled" instead).
  - Any entity entirely in such a zone is "immobilised" unless it succeeds a STR or DEX save (in which case it is pushed to the edge of the zone and grappled instead). Any entity that is thus encased at the start of its turn takes 3d12 pressure damage at the start of each of its turns until it somehow frees itself (it must succeed a fortify roll vs the caster's threshold to move at 5ft, or have a dig speed).
- Thirdly, the caster can create a single fissure as a secondary action, with an origin within the area of the spell (as per the "[Rift](#rift)" spell).
- Alternately, as a secondary action, the caster may create a dust cloud with a radius of up to 30ft which causes "total concealment". Any entities in the cloud when it forms must make a CON save or be blinded. The cloud lasts until the end of the caster's next turn.

**Special**: "True Geomancy" is a legendary magic. It is a fragment of the forces that shaped the earth when it was created.
- All entities aligned to elemental earth are immune to "immobilised" effect of this spell, but not others.
- The spot where it is cast forever resonates with an aura of [spiritual, earth and divine] energies. Mortals born in those lands might be aligned in some way with elemental earth.
- Even after the spell has dissipated it leaves echoes behind. Fissures (as caused by the "[Rift](#rift)" spell) may spontaneously spring up. Likewise lesser elements may be drawn to the spot. This can continue for 108 years if it was cast locally and a millennium if it was cast globally.

**Global**: The spell is realised in an area with a radius of 1600ft. For every extra 4MP the radius increases by 200ft or the duration increases by 1 week.

### Undying Realm
|||
|-|-|
|Name|Undying Realm [Curse, Divine, Profane, Spiritual]|
|Scope|global|
|MP Dice|40|
|Target(s)|1000ft radius centered on a square|+10
|Casting time|10 days|
|Range|close|-1(9)
|Duration|Permanent|+36(45)
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1(44)
|Focus|A part of a fey, divine or fiend|-1(43)
|Material|Water from the land of the dead, a seed of the tree of life|-2(41)
|Concentration|-|
|Save|Cha|

**Description**: Infuse an area with the aura of the tree of life and banish death. The concept of mortality no longer exists in this zone. The remains of mortals brought to this zone, and mortals that die within this zone, return to life at dawn if diurnal (or after the sun has set if nocturnal). They regain all of its SP and MP and up to 12 HP. The possessions of the entity are not returned, unless they were an intrinsic part of its being.

**Limitations**:
- The entity must be a mortal.
- The entity must have a dice total (MP + SP) no more than twice the dice total of the caster.
- The entity is not beholden to the caster and it is not obliged to obey the caster, although it may if it is so inclined.
- The entity may attempt to continue resting (ie not be resurrected) with a Cha save.
- Any entities brought back by this spell die the instant they leave the radius of effect of the Undying Realm, or if the spell ends for whatever reason.

**Upcast**: For every 8MP dice put into the spell, the radius increases by 200ft.

**Special**: The Undying Realm is a legendary magic. It banishes death and breaks the order that divinity set for a small part of reality.
- For every time a caster casts the spell, it gains the grudge of the gods. When "dying" or "doomed", the amount of HP it loses increases by 1 per round. (-2 per round after one casting, -3 after two castings, etc).
- The spell is permanent, but even if the spell is dispelled, the place it is cast forever resonates with an aura of [Curse, Divine, Profane, Spiritual] energies. Mortals born nearby may be cursed or blessed by the gods, or have otherworldly affinities or resistances.
- After the spell is dispelled, the area is still affected as if by a permanent ["Rejuvenate Land"](#rejuvenate-land), likewise, entities that rest here roll a 1d6. On a 1, they gain a curse (as if affected by ["Curse"](#least-curse) cast with 3 MP dice). On a 6 they are healed (as if affected by ["Cure"](#cure) cast with 3 MP dice).
- The caster gains the grudge of a divine entity, and the favour of a [glitch](10-conditions-types.md#divine), the later seldom being a good thing.
