Other users of air magic can use "knowledge:arcana" to recognise that the spell is being cast in the area and use "summon wind sprite" at a higher level to hide their location without breaking the casting.

**Global**: The spell reaches to a range of two miles and gives the caster the location of all objects matching the criteria.

|Damage|2d12+[Sup] bludgeoning|+6 (+2 for being able to do manoeuvres and skills)
|Attack/Manoeuvre|SAP+[Wis]|
|Save|-|

**Description**: Gather a "medium" sized hand out of the earth or chipped rock at the target square. The hand is manipulated as your own. It is considered proficient with any tools and attacks/manoeuvres you are proficient in. Including on the turn it is called, you may use your main action to move the hand 20ft and carry out one of the following actions:
+ Grapple a target (SAP+[Wis]).
+ Shove/Throw a target (SAP+[Wis]).
+ Make a targeted melee attack (SAP+[Wis]).
+ Make any manipulation you can with your own hand, but at disadvantage.

### Glide
|Name|Glide [Wind, Travel]|

|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|2 (8)|
|Target(s)|2 entities or an object no bigger than 15 x 15 x 15ft (200ft)|+1
|Casting time|"main action" or "reaction" (2h + 20min per 8MP)|
|Range|60ft|+1
|Duration|12min (1 day)|+3
|Components|kinetic|
|Concentration|local|-3
|Limit|The target has no control over its fly direction or speed|-2 
|Save|Wis|

**Description**: The target is no longer attracted to the earth. This has the following effect:
- Its jump distance is by x4 the base distance of the roll (after that it slows down and stops).
- When jumping upwards it will hang at the maximum height instead of returning to earth.
- When moving at more than than half its speed, the target must make a threshold=20 acrobatics roll or end up hanging mid-air at an altitude of a few feet.
- When airborne as a result of this spell, a target is carried by the wind at half of the wind's speed.

**Special**: The spell can be cast as a reaction when a target begins to fall. If cast as a reaction, the target descends at ~60ft per round. If cast as a main action on a target that is already falling, it begins to decelerate. This does nothing if the fall distance is less than ~360ft. Otherwise, if the fall is long, for every round the spell effects the target it decelerates 20ft per round (from 360ft), decreasing fall damage by 2d12 per round of falling, to an eventual safe speed of 60ft.

**Global**: When cast globally the spell creates a spherical zone centered on the caster where this effect acts. For every 8 extra MP dice added the zone is expanded by 200ft or the duration increased by a day. Every entity that enters the area and does not succeed a Wis save is affected by the spell.

**Upcast**: The amount harvested increases by 1 large mortal's worth of food and water for every extra MP dice. The radius increases by 5ft for every extra 2MP dice.

**Special**: Harvester mages are often used by marching or retreating armies for logistics and scorched earth. There would likely be ramifications to using this magic, especially on inhabited or claimed lands.

- If the land is infertile (eg ruins, city, subterranean, desert), the MP is expended and the harvest fails.

All valid targets in a radius of 100ft are "invisible" for a week. For every 4MP, the radius increases by 100ft, or the duration increases by a week.

1. The target makes a promise and must fulfil it before the spell ends or suffers the condition permanently. (eg, "I will slay the ogre that terrorises the village."). The condition can still be dispelled as if it was the "Promise" spell cast with the same number of MP dice.
2. The target makes a promise and must either keep fulfilling it for the duration of the spell. (eg, "I promise not to deceive you."). If the target breaks the promise, it suffers the condition for the full duration of the spell (as if it was cast when the target broke the promise).

|C|The target gains the "glowing", "aphonia" or "deafened" condition|

|Save|Wis|

**Description**: The caster creates an illusionary scene which mimics the real scene to all senses except touch and pain. It can do no damage. The scene realistically mimics a real scene, at first glance, but has no material substance. For example:
- An illusionary bridge over a river will hold no weight, but if a rock is thrown against might show the rock bouncing a few steps along the bridge and coming to rest on it (in the meanwhile the real rock passes straight through it).
- An illusionary bonfire would feel warm at a distance, but would fail to melt a block of ice at some distance (although if the ice is placed inside of the area of the "mirage" it would *appear* to melt).

An illusion can be broken in the following manner:
- At a distance, when interacting with the illusion from outside of it, an entity may attempt to disbelieve, and roll a Wis save at disadvantage against the caster's threshold.
- When interacting with the "mirage" from inside it, it may attempt disbelieve it and roll a Wis save against the caster's threshold.
- When an entity interacts with the "mirage" in such a way that the "mirage" seems implausible or suspicious (eg a bonfire failing to melt a block of ice, or the target falling through the bridge), it may roll a Wis save at advantage.
- If the entity has some magic sense, it makes a Wis save against the "mirage" as soon as it detects it.
- If the entity has "true seeing" it automatically sees through the "mirage"

**Upcast**: For every extra MP, the duration increases by 12 min or the radius increases by 5ft.

**Global**: The mirage lasts for a day and has a radius of 400ft. For every 4 extra MP the mirage lasts for an extra day or its radius increases by 400ft.

|Limitation|Global: The spell is weakened if the target is not willing.|-1(11)
|Limitation|Local: The target must be willing.|-1(11)
|Save|Special: Wis|

**Description**: The caster allows a supernatural pact to be sealed between two targets (supplicant and patron). The caster may be one of the targets. "Pact" may work in the following manner:
1. Replicate the effect of "[Promise](#promise)", with a year long duration. Furthermore, the patron knows if the promise has been broken.
2. Chose a one of the patrons attributes: a stat, save, resource pool, ability, skill, or proficiency. A number of times a day equal to the supplicant's [Base], the supplicant may use that attribute (in place of their own as appropriate). *In return* the patron must demand that the supplicant make a promise (as in "[Promise](#promise)") or alternatively the patron may issue a single command to the supplicant on any day that the patron's power is borrowed.

- If a supplicant makes a pact under duress or unwittingly, they may make a Wis save whenever the patron issues a command or if the promise is broken.

|Focus|An item that the target has a strong emotional attachment to.|-1
|Material|Sanctified Earth, and oils which are set on fire and consumed|-2
|Limitation|See below| -4
|Save|Special|

**Description**: The caster performs an intricate ritual and attempts to return a deceased entity back to the mortal realm for one short day (24 hours). The target entity's vessel/body is not needed and is provided by the magic. Likewise the revenant carries equipment/garments it was typically associated with/attached to, unless they are in the possession of another entity.

It returns to the world of the living at dawn if is diurnal (or at dusk if it is nocturnal), appearing before the caster, wherever they may be, as long as it is in the mortal realm, and not sealed by appropriate barriers. The revenant stays in the mortal realm for 24 hours. When its time has expired, its spirit is drawn back to the afterlife, and any physical form it held crumbles to dust if it has not already been destroyed.

The target returns with all of its SP and MP and up to 12 HP.

**Limitations**:
- The entity must be a mortal.
- The entity must have a dice total (MP + SP) no more than twice the dice total of the caster.
- The entity is not beholden to the caster and it is not obliged to obey the caster, although it may if it is so inclined.
-  Likewise the target entity and any divine/spiritual/profane that holds its soul is aware of who is trying return it and may attempt to resist. In this case the caster may disengage fom the ritual or try to force it. If the caster tries to force the issue, the target and caster make an opposed SAP roll. If the caster wins the ritual succeeds (although the caster may wish that it hadn't). If the ritual fails, the spell fails [catastrophically](07-magic-and-spellcasting.md#the-catastrophic-cascade) as if the spell was countered on the caster's location.
- The spell can NEVER be cast on the same target more than once a month.

**Special**: The spell can be cast up to 7 times for the same target. However, on each casting following the first time, either the caster or an entity with at least as many MP or SP dice as the caster's total must be sacrificed (it must die in the ritual). If the sacrifice is not satisfactory, the life is lost but nothing is summoned.

**Upcast**: For each 8MP dice put into the spell, the target stays in the mortal realm for an extra 24 hours.

|Limitation|You must have corpse of an animal or humanoid the appropriate size|-2(-1)
|Concentration|Yes(No)|
|Save|-|

**Description**: A form of pact magic: All corpses of huge or smaller ("huge") within 50ft of the offering (the offering must be within 30ft of the caster) and which are satisfied with the offering (see "special") are animated and become level III corporeal undead. The undead is capable of performing any reflexive or rote task it knew in life, if its body still supports that functionality. 

The undead faithfully follow **the single, initial command** that the caster makes, however the spirits animating the corpses retain their original allegiances. If the command is **completely** fulfilled by the end of the duration of the spell, the animated dead crumble to dust.

If the undead are not destroyed by the end of the spell, or the caster loses concentration, the caster's control of the legion ends. The dead do not return to rest, but become hostile towards all living things. However, these undead will prioritise those groups that they were hostile to in life over other living beings.

**Special**: 
- The offering must include firstly, something of symbolic significance to the dead (eg, their favourite dolfie, the banner of their religion, etc). If dead of multiple allegiances are present in the radius, only those that find the offering significant will be raised.
- If a command is given that would go against this, the caster loses control of all the dead animated by this spell. For example, animating a group of holy knights with this spell and ordering one of them to burn down their old shrine will not only lead to the command not being followed, but to the loss of control over all the dead animated in this way.

**Upcast**: For every MP dice added (4 MP dice for global), the radius of the effect increases by 15ft.

**Global**: The spell has a radius of 1000ft and the duration is 1 week. For every 4 MP dice extra, the casting time increases by 2h, and the radius increases by 300ft. The spell does not require concentration is, **but** the caster cannot cast the spell again as a global spell for a week.

**Notes**: This spell produces a large number of units, possibly in the thousands. It is recommended that the DM controls the legion and uses it as a single group or AoE rather than individually rolling for each undead.

The entity retains all of its powers and MP/MP dice as well as skills, abilities, WIS, INT and CHA. It also uses the HP and SP/SP dice of the vessel. The vessel must be a humanoid that is ["unconscious"](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail) for the whole of the ritual, and ["dying"](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail) during the last round.

When the ritual is complete, the entity takes full control of the mortal vessel and controls it fully as if it was its own. It cannot leave the body it possess until the body is destroyed (reaches minus its HP total) or the spell ends.

The possessing entity is in no way beholden to the caster, but may be inclined to reward them.

When the spell ends one of the following things can happen (the final decision is with the possessing entity):
1. The possessing entity consumes the humanoid body it is possessing and is returned to the spirit realm or its divine/profane realm. The humanoid soul is consigned to the afterlife.
2. The possessing entity allows the humanoid soul to return to the body (hence allowing the sacrifice to live), and is itself consigned to the void.
3. The caster recasts the ritual and provides a new sacrifice. The possessing entity can chose whether to keep using the old body or the new one. Whichever body is discarded, the corresponding body is destroyed and the soul passes to the afterlife.


**Limitations**:
- The entity must be a "spirit", "divine" or a "fiend".
- The entity must have a dice total (MP + SP) no more than three times the dice total of the caster.
- The entity is not beholden to the caster and it is not obliged to obey the caster, although it may if it is so inclined.
- The target entity is aware of who is trying return it and may attempt to resist. In this case the caster may disengage fom the ritual or try to force it. If the caster tries to force the issue, the target and caster make an opposed SAP roll. If the caster wins the ritual succeeds (although the caster may wish that it hadn't). If the ritual fails, the spell fails [catastrophically](07-magic-and-spellcasting.md#the-catastrophic-cascade) as if the spell was countered on the caster's location.
- The spell can NEVER be cast on the same target more than once.

**Upcast**: For each 8MP dice put into the spell, the target stays in the mortal realm for an extra week.

### Mage's Oath
|Name|Mage's Oath [Incantation, Curse, Divine]|
|-|-|
|Scope|local (global)|
|MP Dice|9 (36)|
|Target(s)|Up to 9 willing targets|+8
|Casting time|"full round action" (9 days)|-1

|Duration|1 day (permanent)|+24
|Components|incantation|+1(32)

|Material|1HP worth of blood (global: or one item precious to each participant)|-2
|Limitation|All participants must be willing|
|Save||

**Description**: The caster grants an oath sworn between up to 9 targets to gain real power. The words of the oath, specifically between the participants have the power of the laws of nature. This can also be used to replicate the effect of [Promise](#promise) or [Pact](#pact). Otherwise, the targets can:
1. Exchange or trade for free one or more of their abilities, boons, stats, skills, or even racial traits with other participants. When the spell ends the abilities are returned.
2. Lend or borrow, abilities, boons, stats, skills or racial traits with other participants. However, should one participant of the oath lose what is lent, it is lost by all. Thus if the caster lends his MP to an ally, the MP is *shared* between them, and when one of them loses MP, so does the other. This is especially poignant when HP is shared and lost. Likewise, should one member of the oath die, that which is lent is permanently lost by all.
3. Create a physical law binding one or more participants. However, if the law gives some kind of benefit, it must give an equal drawback, as determined by the DM. Likewise, if some kind of condition is involved, the fulfilment of this condition must be at least somewhat plausible.
  - For example, the oath may be "I will fear nothing while I'm with you", granting immunity to "frightened" in the presence of another participant. This would also imply that the one making the oath would *always* be "frightened" in their absence.
  - "I will not die until I have seen the sunset", may make one immortal, but it will guarantee death once the sunset is seen. Likewise if such an oath is made when seeing the sunset is literally impossible, the universe (read: the DM) MUST contrive an event that makes it instead inevitable, literally or figuratively. In this case, a blind paladin who swears such an oath may miraculously regain her sight in time to see the sunset, or see it in her dreams.

**Special**:
- All targets of the spell innately know that they are making a mage's oath when the spell is cast, and have the power to refuse to participate if they are willing.
- Dispelling a Mages's Oath means that all participants of the oath, and the one dispelling it, suffer the effects of the oath.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice, the spell lasts an extra day.

**Global**: The effect is permanent until dispelled.

|MP Dice|10 (40)|
|Target(s)|80ft radius, (3/4 mile radius)|+22

|Duration|12 minutes (1 weeks)|+12(19)
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1(18)

|Proficiency|Water breathing|+1(54)
|Concentration|local|-3(51+12=63)
|Save|Str,Dex,Con (Else no damage from tendrils)| -3(60)

**Description**: A crown of ice appears upon the caster's head(s) (if it has one or more). The caster takes control of all water within an 80ft radius with the following effects:
- All entities of the caster's choice gain the following for the duration of the spell:
  - A 30ft swim speed
  - Water walking
  - An alignment to [water]
  - Water breathing and the ability to communicate with all entities aligned to [water]
  - Immunity to "charmed" and "catatonic".
  - Heavy cover from blocks of ice or tendrils of water.
- As a "secondary action", the caster can freeze or melt any amount of water in the area of effect. Any entity caught in the frozen areas can attempt to break free with a Str save, however, this is often futile, as even if they break free, they may still be surrounded by walls of ice 10-20 feet thick. (This is very useful as a barrier)
- As an action call watery tendrils to strike any number of targets in the area of effect, dealing 4d12 percussive damage on a failed Dex save. If the caster so choses, the tendrils an throw a target up to 80ft (or move a willing target the same distance).
- As an action, cause (CON save to negate) or cure bleeding in any number of targets.
- Control the movement water as a "move action", including:
  - Raising or lowering water levels at will.
  - Changing speed and flow of water in the area at will (but induing currents of no more than 240ft per round)
- Entities aligned with fire have disadvantage to all attacks in the area of effect, and saving throws against their abilities/spells/etc are made at advantage.
- The zone of effect moves with the caster, but at no more than 90ft per round.

**Special**: "Mandate of the Deep" is a legendary magic. It gifts a part of the material realm to the lords of the deep.
- All entities aligned with water have advantage against effects caused by the spell.
- If the area where the spell is cast is already claimed by another elemental lord of water, the caster forever gains their grudge.
- The spot where it is cast forever resonates with an aura of [spiritual, water] energies. Mortals born in those lands/seas might be aligned in some way with elemental water.
- Even after the spell has dissipated it leaves echoes behind, lesser elementals or supernatural mist may spontaneously spring up in the place it was cast for 108 years if it was cast locally and a millennium if it was cast globally.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice, the radius of the spell increases by 15ft.

**Global**: The locale within 3/4 miles of the caster is sworn to the realm of water, and the caster is its regent. The spell acts as normal, with the exception that it has a radius of 3/4 of a mile.

### Realm of Flame
|Name|Realm of Flame [Spiritual, Fire, Destruction]|

- Everything within the flames in heavily concealed.
- All entities that first enter the area or first start their turn in it, must make a Cha save or become catatonic. The entity may retry the save at the end of each turn. Those that succeed are immune to the "catatonic" condition until the end of the spell.
- When an entity first enters the area on its turn, or starts its turn in the area, it makes a Con save or takes 10d8 fire damage. On a successful save it takes half damage. 

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice, increase the radius by 10ft and height by 5ft or increase the damage by 2d8.

**Special**: The realm of flame is a legendary magic. It is the embodiment of flaming destruction.
- All entities aligned or immune to "fire" are immune to the "catatonic" effect caused by the spell.
- The spot where it is cast forever resonates with an aura of [spiritual, fire and destructive] energies. Mortals born in those lands might be aligned in some way with elemental flame.
- Even after the spell has dissipated it leaves echoes behind, "[Meadow of Flame](#meadow-of-flame)" or lesser elementals may spontaneously spring up in the place it was cast for 108 years if it was cast locally and a millennium if it was cast globally.

**Global**: Realises the Realm of Flame onto the caster's current location. The radius is 1 mile. For every extra 4MP the radius increases by 200ft and the height increases by 10ft and the damage increases by 2d8.

### Undying Realm
|||
|-|-|
|Name|Undying Realm [Curse, Divine, Profane, Spiritual]|
|Scope|global|
|MP Dice|40|
|Target(s)|1000ft radius centered on a square|+10
|Casting time|10 days + 1 day per 4MP|
|Range|close|-1(9)
|Duration|Permanent|+36(45)
|Components|incantation, kinetic|-1(44)
|Focus|A part of a fey, divine or fiend|-1(43)
|Material|Water from the land of the dead, a seed of the tree of life|-2(41)
|Concentration|-|
|Save|Cha|

**Description**: Infuse an area with the aura of the tree of life and banish death. The concept of mortality no longer exists in this zone. The remains of mortals brought to this zone, and mortals that die within this zone, return to life at dawn if diurnal (or after the sun has set if nocturnal). They regain all of its SP and MP and up to 12 HP. The possessions of the entity are not returned, unless they were an intrinsic part of its being.

**Limitations**:
- The entity must be a mortal.
- The entity must have a dice total (MP + SP) no more than twice the dice total of the caster.
- The entity is not beholden to the caster and it is not obliged to obey the caster, although it may if it is so inclined.
- The entity may attempt to continue resting (ie not be resurrected) with a Cha save.
- Any entities brought back by this spell die the instant they leave the radius of effect of the Undying Realm, or if the spell ends for whatever reason.

**Upcast**: For every 8MP dice put into the spell, the radius increases by 200ft.

**Special**: The Undying Realm is a legendary magic. It banishes death and breaks the order that divinity set for a small part of reality.
- For every time a caster casts the spell, it gains the grudge of the gods. When "dying" or "doomed", the amount of HP it loses increases by 1 per round. (-2 per round after one casting, -3 after two castings, etc).
- The spell is permanent, but even if the spell is dispelled, the place it is cast forever resonates with an aura of [Curse, Divine, Profane, Spiritual] energies. Mortals born nearby may be cursed or blessed by the gods, or have otherworldly affinities or resistances.
- After the spell is dispelled, the area is still affected as if by a permanent ["Rejuvenate Land"](#rejuvenate-land), likewise, entities that rest here roll a 1d6. On a 1, they gain a curse (as if affected by ["Curse"](#least-curse) cast with 3 MP dice). On a 6 they are healed (as if affected by ["Cure"](#cure) cast with 3 MP dice).
- The caster gains the grudge of a divine entity, and the favour of a [glitch](10-conditions-types.md#divine), the later seldom being a good thing.
