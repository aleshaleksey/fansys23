# Types, Races, Species and Templates

Some roleplaying fantasy species support different playable races (eg humans, elves, dwarves, etc) and some do not. Systems like DnD and Pathfinder have "baked in" races. Other systems like "Ryuutama" allow only humans. This system supports races from different creature types, as this can add an enormous amount of flavour to a game, and a good amount of mechanical complexity, but does not consider them a necessary core rule, as this is considered to be setting specific.

## Races and Species

The system does not debate whether different races are different species or not. This is a setting specific decision.

___
## Example Template

All characters start with a template. A template is a set of abilities, traits and properties. Usually it is associated with a race or creature type.

**BEWARE**: Not all fantasy worlds are going to be inhabited by the same entities. If these do not suit your game, it is recommended that you sit down with your group and use the [template rules](#making-templates) to craft a set that suits your world and game.

### Human (level-1 template = 8 points)

Human represents the human race. The human race is the base. Humans have no special senses, resistances, movement modalities or spooky abilities. To compensate this, they adapt quickly to new environments, and learn appropriate skills quickly as soon as they are old enough to walk. Humans have a lifespan that does not exceed a century, reach a breeding age in their teens and can produce up to two dozen offspring in their lifetime.

## Making templates

Below one will find a basic set of rules for making races and templates. These are not intended for players to use. They are a tool for DMs, and perhaps the group as a whole when crafting a gaming world and populating it with fantasies.

All characters start with a template. A template is a set of abilities, traits and properties. Usually it is associated with a race or creature type. Not all templates are equal. Some templates (eg dragon, angel) are blatantly more powerful than others. In order to offset this, templates have levels. Templates exist for level 1, level 5 and level 10. They can also be created for other levels.

For higher power games, where players wish to play angels, devils, dragons and other things, higher level templates should be used. For such games,  it is recommended that all players use higher level templates, as low level templates with extra class levels mix poorly with higher level templates.

### Basic template rules

- Templates are applied after stats are assigned at character creation.
- Templates/races of different level should NOT be used in the same game.
- A template can also be applied later on if something special happens to a character, however, this must come at the cost of class levels, unless the group forsakes balance.
- All characters in a game should have the same total level (template + character levels).
- The HP of a character is determined by the combined template + character levels and the total LEVEL for the purpose of **HP = [(Character level) + (Template level) - 1]**.
- The SP dice, MP dice pools, level points and skill points are determined by character level alone. Although a template may grant additional points (though this is not what it is for!).

___
### The base character without templates

A level 1 character, before being build, has:
- **Size**: Medium
- **Stats**: No modifier to any stats.
- **Movement**: A walking speed of 30ft and no other movement modalities
- **Senses**:  Hearing, Sight, Smell, Taste, and Touch.
- **Sight**: Sight in bright light and disadvantage in dim light (aka, no dark-vision or low-light vision). No sight whatsoever in complete darkness (eg a deep cave).
- **Limbs**: Two prehensile limbs.
- **Type**: Humanoid (needs to breathe, drink, eat, and sleep).
- **Proficiencies**: All characters are proficient with one language.

___
### The base template

The base template allows the following:

**Stat changes**: Add +2 or +1 to any number of stats to a total of +4 or less. For each point added to a stat, a point must be subtracted from another stat. After all additions and subtractions, the total must remain zero.

**Size change:** Change size to small or large. This comes with advantages and disadvantage.

**Template points**: A template gains **8 template points**. Template points may be spent in a packet, or one by one.
