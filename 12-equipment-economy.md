This chapter discusses resources, basic fantasy economy and item/equipment prices. Most "adventurers" need equipment, weapons and supplies in some shape and form, so they are covered here.

___
## Economy and economies

We assume that the settings that will be used with this system might range from classical/ancient to early medieval, to renaissance to industrial revolution, and might not be based on european civilisations. The availability of natural resources, knowledge/crafting techniques and "human" resources (labour) will naturally vary, which will affect item prices and availability. This will also be affected by how high or low magic the setting is. With this in mind three lists are presented: "ancient", "medieval" and "late".

Of course if a group has its own setting, then why not have your own list?

___
### Ancient Setting

In this kind of setting some sorts of knowledge may well be very well developed (Rome, Egypt, China are good examples of this), but population densities are generally are quite low, working of iron is limited and poorly developed. On the other hand slavery is generally widespread, so labour costs can be minimal for manual labour. Weapons and armour are somewhat "simple" although arguably this is more related to suitability rather than lack of ability to make something more complex. The world is not mapped, and much of it is ruled by monsters, spirits and other strange forces. Gods and demons might walk the world. At the same time there might be few ruins of previous civilisations.

___
### Early Medieval and Dark ages

This is a classical dark adventuring setting. Many fields of knowledge, sciences for example, are lost. There many ruins of fallen empire. The population density is low. Possibly much of the population is bound in serfdom, keeping labour costs low. On the hand iron-work develops to a higher level, so heavy armour and weapons designed to overcome it begin to develop. Much of the world is not mapped and there are many ruins of civilisations that have been lost to time. Monsters and spirits are still rampant.

___
### Late, renaissance and industrial age

This is the usual "adventuring guilds" settings. All kinds of weapons and armours are available. Some have become obsolete (under some situations). Firearms become available. Techniques of extracting resources and crafting become very efficient, and all kinds of sciences flourish. Labour costs are high, but productivity of labour also increases due to advanced techniques and industrialisation. Population densities are generally high. Most of the world has been at least crudely mapped. Most ruins have been found and at least some are explored. It is possible that monsters and other "inhuman" forces have retreated (but who knows?).

___
### The Supernatural Economy

The effects of magic on an economy should be taken into account. A society, and economy, where magic is common would likely be affected (unless there are certain taboos against mixing the natural and supernatural world).

As an example, a society with many nature mages would likely see the cost of agricultural produce both decline and stabilise. A society where fire magic is common, would likely develop advanced smelting, increasing the availability of steel and iron. Golems and elementals may replace certain workers entirely.

The tables here do not take this into account, and assume that users of supernatural abilities are not common enough to affect prices and availability of most goods. That said, there are no mechanistic limitations on how common this kind people are in a game world, and a gaming group should keep this in mind when creating a fantasy world.

___
### Currency

The most common currency was generally silver, although gold, copper, bronze, electrum (gold/silver allow) and other currencies have been used. The main prerequisite was that the material can be worked with available tools, does not degrade much over time and is scarce. Gold generally was worth 10-20 times more than silver. Copper currency was used mostly locally. However, silver coin or trade bars of various sizes were the most common. Good examples include the English "silver penny" (1.4g-1.55g) and the Athenian silver drachma (~4.3g).

This also brings up the phantom of different currencies between kingdoms. If a group is playing a socially complex game, it may be worth introducing different convertible currency or tender between powers. A roughly ~5% conversion fee seems to be a fair average to use as a starting point.

By default, this game uses an anachronistic mix of modern pound (lb) measurement together with a silver obol (1/6th of a drachma), weighing ~0.76g to give us 600 silver pieces (sp) per lb (actual Obols had a weight closer to ~0.72g). The choice is made to have a practical minimum unit. Although of course most sane kingdoms would have larger denominations. I would recommend a modified drachma (~4.5g, 100/lb) and dekadrachma (~45g, 10/lb). These values are used for ease of calculation and not any semblance of pseudo-historical accuracy.

|Currency|Weight(lb)|Conversion from obols|Weight (g)|
|-|-|-|-|
|Obol|1/600|1|0.76|
|Drachma|1/100|x10|4.5|
|Dekadrachma|1/10|x100|45|
|Silver penny|1/300[1]|x2|1.5|

1. Remember, we're using modern lb and a "modified" penny and not the measure with 240d/lb.

More importantly, the lists will give a cost in "days of labour", which are equivalent to 12 manhours. Often, in a world where everything is made by hand and not always stockpiled, the labour availability is more important than the material or currency cost.

___
### Labour costs and crafting times

Crafting costs are a sum of the labour cost and the material costs. Labour costs depend on the level of the worker, and the number of man hours that they need to work to complete the task.

See [below](#labour-costs) for the actual labour cost table.

___
### Materials

Materials come in a hierarchy of hardness/quality. Materials higher on the scale have superior qualities, are harder to work with, generally rarer, give bonuses to attack/damage/armour/durability, etc. Materials lower on the scale are usually cheaper and easier to work with, but also make for less effective tools, weapons and armour. 

#### Material Ranks

Materials have an absolute rank. Absolute rank is important for the "sunder" manoeuvre rules. The highest rank is 0. If the weapon used when performing the "sunder" manoeuvre is made of a "lower ranking material, the total amount of damage is reduced by 1, and the weapon making the attack takes 1 point of damage. If the weapon used in the attack is made of "higher" materials, the amount of damage is 2 per damage dice of the attacking weapon instead of 1.

#### Material types

As a rule, each item of equipment can be made of materials of the same kind, but of different grades and maintain effectiveness. For example, metal swords (tungsten/adamantium, titanium/mithral, steel, iron, bronze) will all be effective to an extent, but a wooden sword is likely to be as effective as a glorified club. The types of material are classified as: cloth, hide, bone, ivory, wood, resin, ceramic, stone and metal. For simplicity, the following categories can be sensibly unified.
- **Soft**: Cloth, hide.
- **Medium**: Wood, Resin, Bone.
- **Hard**: Ivory, ceramic, stone.
- **Metallic**: Metals.

#### Material level

Material level is classified from one I to V. Level I materials make equipment that performs and costs as per base statics. Higher level material give a higher durability, give a higher attack/damage/armour/shield bonus, but also take longer to craft and are generally more expensive or simply unobtainable in some situations. Some higher grade materials can have other benefits or even disadvantage.

Availability, crafting time and price of higher level materials may be lower in renaissance and later settings.

|Level|Attack bonus|Damage bonus|Armour bonus|Shield bonus|Typical cost|Crafting time|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|0|0|0|0|x1|x1|
|2|+1|+1|+1|+1|x2|x2|
|3|+2|+1|+2|+1|x9|x4|
|4|+3|+2|+3|+2|x64|x12|
|5|+4|+2|+4|+2|x625|x108|

#### Material table

This table contains a basic list of materials. This can, and should, be expanded with setting-specific materials.

|Absolute rank|Material|Level|Type|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|Divine Source|5|Any|Endows divine alignment, indestructible by lower rank materials except "profane"|
|1|Adamantium|4|Metal| Weight x2 of base weight, indestructible by lower rank materials|
|2|Dragon Source|4|Hide/Bone/Ivory|gives advantage to intimidate animals and monsters|
|3|True Gems|4|Hard: Stone|Indestructable by level 2 and lower materials, cost x128 base cost|
|4|Semi-precious Gems|3|Hard: Stone||
|5|Mithral|3|Metal|weight x1/2 of base weight, does not corrode|
|6|Fiend Source|4|Any|Endows profane alignment|

|16|Softwood|1|Medium: Wood||
|17|Animal Silk|3|Soft: Cloth||
|18|Animal Hide|1|Soft: Hide||
|19|Cotton|2|Soft: Cloth||
|20|Wool|1|Soft: Cloth||

___
## The lists

The lists a monetary cost, a labour cost and an availability table. The availability should be taken with a large pinch of salt and is meant as a guide for settings. If availability is "no" the weapon is not generally available or the technology or technique to make it does not exist. "Rare" means it was available at some point of the age, but were not commonly used.

If availability is "no" the item cannot be made, but may be bought from specialist suppliers at x10 the price.

If availability is "rare", the item cost is x2 and the crafting time is x2.

If the time is "ancient", crafting times for mostly metal items is x2 the base time. If the time is "late", the crafting cost is 1/2 the base time.

Importantly crafting time can be shared between several artisans. Thus if an item has a listed crafting time of "100 days", then ten artisans can usually craft it in 10 days.

### Labour Costs

Labour costs are given in silver (sp) per day (10-12 hours). Labour that does not need to be paid for, still has to be fed. Generally it should be assumed that the wages of unskilled workers, trained worker, mercenaries and scribes includes food and board where appropriate. The wages are given for medium sized humanoids. Larger entities, like giants, will have a significantly higher upkeep, but will also accomplish certain tasks, especially construction and mining a lot more quickly and effectively. Both of these factors mean that wages for those entities would be higher.

|Labour type|ancient |medieval |late |
|-|-|-|-|
|Unskilled|0|1|2|
|Trained|0|2|~5|
|Artisan (mason)|0-4|8|20|
|Artisan (smith)|0-4|16|40|
|mercenary (foot, lvl-2)|0-6|6|20|
|mercenary (specialist, lvl-3)|12|24|50|
|mercenary (captain, lvl-5)|100|200|500|
|scribe/priest, lvl-3|12|6|20|
|magistrate, lvl-3|200|200|500|
|initiate, lvl-3|special|40|500|
|mage, higher level|special|special|special|

**Untrained**: This refers to untrained workforce that can be used for basic, but not necessarily easy work. This includes cleaners, fruit-pickers, and workers for digging ditches and carrying loads.

**Trained**: This refers to labourers that carry out work which requires several months or years of training to perform well. This includes miners, brick-layers, wagon drivers and sailors.

**Artisan**: Refers to craftsmen with rare and valuable skills, such as smiths, masons, bowyers, alchemists, jewellers, artists, engineers. They have significant practice in their arts, but quality varies.

**Mercenary**: This refers to low level hired combatants. This can be both *bona fide* mercenaries, as well as caravan guards, mounted messengers, and levied militia. They are loath to fight to the death, engage in expeditions lasting longer than a few weeks, or take on jobs with an obvious and significant risk of not coming back.

**Mercenary, Specialist**: This refers to archers, scouts, basic cavalry. Mercenaries will seldom fight to the death, and need significant persuasion if the job carries a risk of death or lasts longer than a month.

**Mercenary, Captain**: This refers to an NPC combatant with a significant amount of experience that can also lead a small unit. This kind of mercenary can be experienced in melee or ranged combat and may even have supernatural abilities. They usually demands a high fee for their services. This can also refer to lower level assassins.

**Scribe**: Literate individuals who can transcribe manuscripts, pen letters, and perform similar roles.

**Magistrate**: Ranking members of society, empowered with the rights and knowledge necessary to perform legal services. Magistrates are useful when dealing with nobility, major trade deals, or during dubious dealings for furthering one's own interests. Access to a magistrate is understandably expensive.

**Initiate**: Initiates into the supernatural, who can perform simple spellcasting. They are loathe to enter combat, but often not adverse to exploration.

**Mage**: This refers to any spell caster that has level 3 or higher spellcasting. Mages can often be persuaded to perform services, usually in ritual casting, if they believe it is worth their while. The cost is generally high, and more often than not, it is not paid in gold or silver. Most mages are loathe to enter combat, but are not necessarily adverse to exploration.

___
### Upkeep
Upkeep is distinct from labour cost, as it accounts only for minimal costs associated with keeping the labourer/hireling in working condition, and not the wages. This includes the upkeep cost of food, board and specialist equipment. It can also include the costs of various social/societal functions and rituals needed to maintain the position. For example, a magistrate may need to participate in "expensive" social events to retain a degree of "respectability", a mercenary may need to attend training and replace equipment, and a mage may need maintain a supply of rare and expensive material components.

This table is for medium sized humanoids. For every increase in size category, upkeep is increased by a factor of 4.

|Item|ancient |medieval |late |
|-|-|-|-|
|Unskilled|0.5|1|2|
|Trained|0.5|2|4|
|Artisan (mason)|1|2|10|

___
### Resources

This table provides some numbers for how much of a resource one can expect to harvest from an area. An acre is 121 x 360 feet or about 24 x 72 5ft squares.

|Item|Yield ancient|Yield medieval|Yield late
|-|-|-|-|
|Wheat|320lb|320lb|800lb|
|Apple|4000lb|4000lb|8000lb|
|Lumber||||
|Iron||||
|Marble||||

**Wheat**: Yield is per acre. Usually 1g of seeds was sown for 12-100g of harvest. Lower yield in earlier ages were associated with higher yields of straw which is also an important material. You need about half a dozen peasants for 10 acres.

**Rope**: 60ft of rope that can be used for climbing, of tying off animals. This weights 6lb for hemp and 3lb for silk ropes. The durability is 4. Hemp ropes for rigging are four times heavier and cost four times as much. This rope can support 1000lb, or 300lb during a fall of 10ft or more without snapping. Every time the rope takes such a fall, it takes one point of damage.

**Miner's Pick**: A heavy, durable pick used for breaking rocky ground or leveraging it apart. It is a necessary tool for using "fortify" to fortify or dig through rock/rocky ground. This kind of pick can be used as a weapon, but attack rolls with it are made at disadvantage. It deals 1d10 piercing damage and is wielded in two hands.

**Shovel**: A sturdy shovel. "Fortify", "harvest" or "prospect" rolls which involve digging are made at disadvantage without a shovel. It can be used as a weapon (attack rolls are made at disadvantage), and deals 1d8 slashing damage.

**Torch**: A length of wood, usually dipped in tar. When lit, a torch sheds bright light in 20ft, and dim light in 40ft. Its light can be seen within a mile. It will burn out within 30 minutes and will be blown out by extreme precipitation or extreme wind. Torches are ideal for setting things on fire.

**Candle**: A wax candle. Made of bees' wax or tallow. A candle will shed dim light within 10ft. It will burn for 4 hours. Its light can be seen from ~800ft away. An unshielded candle will be blown out by severe wind or precipitation.

**Lamp**: A glass or metal oil lamp, with a small reservoir for oil (no more than 1lb) and a wick. A lamp sheds bright light in 20ft and dim light in 40ft.

**Small Backpack**: A sturdy backpack of cloth or leather that can carry up to 30lb, or a volume of 10 gallons, whatever is smallest. It leaves a traveller's hands free for other activities.

**Large Backpack**: A sturdy backpack of cloth or leather, usually with a wooden frame. It can carry up to 90lb, or a volume of 30 gallons, whatever is smallest. It leaves a traveller's hands free for other activities.

**Blanket**: A heavy woollen blanket big enough to wrap 2 medium sized humanoids. It gives a +2 on CON saves for resting in cold weather (where applicable).

**Bedroll**: A complete sleeping set, complete with a thick felt/woollen sleeping matt and blanket. It gives a +4 on CON saves for resting in cold weather (where applicable).

**Tent**: A tent of canvas and wood big enough for 6 medium sized humanoids. It gives a +2 to ameliorate rolls on terrain that is not swamp, dense forest, or steep slopes. It takes up 5x10ft and takes 30 minutes to assemble.

**Yurt**: A portable dwelling construction of hides, cloth, wood and bone favoured by nomadic peoples. It counts as a dwelling and obviates the need for an ameliorate/fortify roll for camping (although it is still better to make one to fortify one's camp). A yurt takes up 15x15ft and takes 3 hours to assemble.

**Cart**: A light, two or four wheeled wooden cart, usually without an awning. Typically a cart is 5x10ft long and can house 8 passengers and 2 drivers, transporting up to 4000lb, but no more than the drag weight of the beasts of burden pulling it. Carts can typically travel on, and off, road. The speed of a wagon is 30ft on road and 20ft off road. A wagon cannot traverse difficult terrain.

**Wagon**: A heavy, four wheeled cart, usually with an awning. A wagon typically is 5x15ft in length, 10ft in height and can house 12 passengers and 2 drivers, transporting up to 8000lb, but no more than the drag weight of the beasts of burden pulling it. Wagons can typically travel on, and off, road. The speed of a wagon is 25ft on road and 15ft off road. A wagon cannot traverse difficult terrain.

**War chariot**: This is a light, two wheeled platform (5x5ft), that carries a driver and up to 3 passengers. In combat it can carry a driver and a single medium sized combatant. A combatant riding chariot may use unwieldy and heavy weapons, as if they were standing on flat, open terrain (if space permits). A chariot with one horse can travel at 40ft, with 2 horses- 50ft, with 4 horses - 60ft. A chariot can be driven off road. It can traverse difficult terrain at 10ft.

**Carriage**: A carriage is a closed wagon approximately 12ft in length and 6ft in width. For combat purposes it takes up 2 squares. A carriage can house up to 6 passengers inside, as well as up to 4 crew. a carriage drawn by 2 horses (a pair) has a speed of 30ft, by 4 horses - 40ft, by 6 horses - 50ft. Travels cannot travel faster than their beasts of burden, unless travelling down hill. Carriages can only travel on roads or relatively flat, solid ground, albeit at half speed. They are seldom suitable for cross country driving.

**Canoe**: A canoe is a light, narrow, rowing boat that can carry up to 4 medium sized humanoids. It has a speed of 50ft, a length of 12-18ft, and a weight of 40lb.

**Skiff**: This refers to a boat that can hold between 4-10 medium size humanoids and has a length of no more than 18ft. It requires 1-3 crew. Rowing skiffs typically have a speed of 30ft, while sailing skiffs can have speeds of up to 100ft in good winds or 30ft in poor winds.

**Longships**: A narrow hull ship, typically with a single mast and between 16-80 oarsmen. They can be between 40ft-120ft long, with displacements of ~20-60 tons. And can maintain speeds of ~90ft (90 miles per day, 180 if the crew pull double shifts). Longships were typically not armed *per se*, but the crew was often trained in combat.

**Sailing ship (small)**: This refers to any sailing ship with one or two masts and a displacement of 20-60 tons and a length of 30-60ft. Depending on size and journey length, it can take 4-20 crewmen. This can be either a square-rig of ancient times, or a caravel of the medieval period. The typical speed is 100ft (200 miles per day) in good wind and 30ft (60 miles per day) in poor winds.

**Carrack**: Carracks are sailing ships with 3 masts and a high rear castle. They have mix of square and triangular sails. They can generally handle long oceanic journeys, but are seldom made to carry large amounts of cargo. They tend to be 60ft-100ft long, and have a displacement of 100-1000 tons. A carrack can be equipped with up to 10 canons per 100 tons of displacement. This is the classic "sailing ship" of the earth colonial era. The cost is quoted for a 200 ton carrack, equipped with 10 canons (or ballistae), which is a typical tonnage for the class. A carrack needs a crew of about 10, but prefers ~40, and can transport 100-500 soldiers over short distances. A carrack has a speed of 120ft (240 miles per day) in good winds and 40ft (80 miles per day) in poor winds.

*Keep*: A stone keep measures approximately 48 x 48 x 48 feet, has 3-4 stories and walls about 4-6 feet thick. The crafting days can be split between any number of workers and include procurement and transport costs. Even if additional man power is available, medium sized humanoids will not accomplish this task in less than 3 months by conventional means.

**Entrenching tools**: This is a full set of equipment needed to fortify a a field position or make a simple dwelling. It includes, hammer, chisel, axe, shovel, knives and a number of other implements.

**Farmer's Equipment**: Farmer's equipment consists of yokes, ploughs, shovels and other minimal equipment needed to raise crops. Animals not included.

**Smith's tools**: A minimal set of tools needed to make use of a forge or make a field forge. Using a field forge gives -5 on all crafting rolls. The set include hammers, vice, chisels, small anvil and other implements. The set weighs about 30lb.

**Smith's forge**: A complete forge. This is not mobile and consists of furnace as well as all other tools and structures for turning an iron ingot into an implement.

**Musical instruments (simple)**: This mostly includes simple wind instruments made of reed, with no metal parts and no rare materials. These would be welcome at a festival, a fey glade, ora village tavern, but might get you laughed out of town or executed at a king's court.

**Musical instruments (average)**: This includes more robust wind instruments and certain percussion, such as tambourines. Certain simpler string instruments would fall in this category. They might contain mixture of wooden, hide and metal parts and would be acceptable either as a performance in a town's tavern or as part of a band or orchestra. A buffoon at a court might use instruments from this category.

**Musical instrument (complex)**: This includes most string instruments (guitars/lutes, violins, harps, lyres), as brass and certain others. These would be acceptable at many mortal courts and would draw crowds at backwater settlements for their rarity.

**Musical instrument (exquisite)**: This includes things like pianos, church organs and other large, complex instruments. They are generally nor easily transported.

# Notes

1. Currency is quite interesting and worth reading up on. For simplicity I am sticking with silver.
2. Tracking down historical prices is quite laborious and difficult. It is actually questionable whether historical prices should be relied on at all in a game. Especially since game balance by equipment cost is probably more important for us than historical accuracy.
3. Interestingly the costs do not vary as much as one would expect from DnD and PF list prices
