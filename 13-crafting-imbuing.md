# Crafting and Imbuing
Crafting is the production of various items, and wares from raw materials. Imbuing is adding supernatural powers or properties to a crafted item, either during crafting or afterwards.

Crafting lies at the heart of both human civilisation, and, indirectly, many RPGs, even if there are no explicit mechanics for it in a given gaming system.

In FanSys, any item that is described in the game can be crafted бы either player or non-player characters. Although using the crafting system does not fit all games, due to the requisite time costs.

## Crafting

### The Crafting Process

### Skills Used
Depending on what is being created different skills are used. Sometimes multiple skills are needed. For example, building a castle may require masonry and carpentry for the structure, engineering for the design, tinkering for traps and so on. Thus common sense should be applied. In cases where multiple skills are needed, each skill roll must succeed for the crafting to succeed. A roll is not necessarily required. For example, it can be assumed that a hundred workers will eventually build a castle, and the poor rolls of some will merely cancel out the brilliant rolls of others.

As usual, other skills in the same skill group can substitute the main skill with a penalty. However, tool proficiencies cannot be eschewed for crafting.

If multiple skills or tool proficiencies are required, they can be supplied by different characters involved in the crafting process.

|Weapon (heavy weapons)|Fortify(smith's tools*)|* may vary if using special materials|
|Weapon (stave)|Fortify(carpentry)||

### Crafting equipment and environment
A character generally requires a suitable workspace and equipment. Particularly good or poor working conditions and environment affect the outcome. The following table summarises this:
|Factor|Effect|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Poor Workspace|-6|Alchemy in the middle of a forest|
|Poor Conditions|-6|Fine woodwork in a cart that is shaking|
|Poor/improvised tools|-6|Digging a ditch with only your hands|
||||
|Superior Workspace|+4|A royal alchemist's laboratory|
|Superior Conditions|Advantage|Literally the perfect conditions|
|Superior Tools|+4|Divine gem-cutting tools|

___
### Crafting Time
The time needed to craft an item is defined by its complexity, and the difficulties of processing and working with the raw materials, the skill of the artisan(s) making it and the quality of the tools and working space available.

In general the crafting time of an item (in sp) is equal to: **[Base price] / 20**

This is an approximation which assumes that most of the cost of any item is the cost labour and equipment used to make it, and material costs are general low in comparison (which is not always true, but keeps things simple).

___
### Crafting Costs
Crafting items for a character is generally cheaper, as it means one can eliminate labour cost completely, however, if the tools are particularly expensive and mst be procured, it an also be more expensive. Likewise, the crafting time, is a major immaterial cost.

This leaves the main variable crafting cost, the material used to make the item, and the material expended in the crafting. For example when smithing a sword, not only does one use the iron for the blade, leather and other materials for the grip, but also, for example, the coal used in the forge.

In general, recommended material costs are as follows:

|Item Kind|Material Cost|
|-|-|
|weapons, armour, tools, devices and clothes|**1sp x [quality mod] x [item weight in lb] x 2**|
|structures|**1sp x [quality mod] x [number of 5ft cubes the structure encompasses] x 2**|
|jewellery|**100sp x [quality mod] x [weight in lb] x 2**|
|medicine, poison and alchemical goods|**10sp x [quality mod] x [number of doses] x 2**|

### Eschewing Reality
In reality, some seemingly simple items, like bows took a very long time to make, since drying and processing the wood, and other materials for composite bows, took months. Understandably, we eschew these requirements for most crafting processes in the game, assuming that "processed" materials that do not require these very long maturation processes are available.
