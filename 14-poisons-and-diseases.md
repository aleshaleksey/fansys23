This chapter covers the rules for various poisons and diseases. It is not necessary to use these rules, since basic rules on the [poisoned condition](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail) and on [poison damage](10-conditions-types.md#biological-damage) exist. However, for some campaigns, especially those in lower magic settings and campaigns with various forms of intrigue it is useful to have more rules on poison. Likewise, while diseases and plagues can be can be played narratively, rules can serve as a guide as to how they would normally play out.

___
## Poisons
Poisons are substances that prevent the organisms of mortals from functioning. Some supernatural poisons can even affect [spirits](10-conditions-types.md#spiritual), [divine entities](10-conditions-types.md#divine) or [fiends](10-conditions-types.md#profane). Most, but not all, poisons have a conventional antidote.

___
### Properties of a Poison
Poisons have a several properties that can be described by game mechanics:
- Threshold
- Potency
- Duration
- Speed
- Mode of Application
- Affected system
- Effect

#### Threshold
How difficult it is to resist the poison's effects. This is the save threshold of the poison.

#### Potency
This is the magnitude of the effect of the poison. In reality, potency can be increased with dose size or by inherent properties of the poison, but the mechanics do not necessarily distinguish between the two.

#### Duration
By default, the conditions caused by a poison last for a week, while damage persists until it is healed by some means (for example by resting). The effects of some poisons (notably food poisoning) last for a day, while the effects of some particularly vile poisons are permanent.

#### Onset
Poisons can be fast acting or slow acting. Unless stated otherwise, a poison acts at the start of an entity's next turn, unless its mode of application is ingestion, in which case, the poison acts within an hour. Monster venom is fast acting when unrefined. Purified monster venom can be fast or slow acting. The speed is written as "immediate", or a given duration (eg, "10 minutes"). In this case the duration is the delay after an entity is "poisoned" that the poison takes effect.

#### Mode of Application
Poisons are generally most effective inside of the body. Some poisons are better at getting inside the body than others. The modes, listed by dominance, are:
1. **Perception**: This poison enters the body as soon as it is perceived with any sense. These poisons are always supernatural and are also effective when MP damage is inflicted.
2. **Contact**: This poison enters the body when it makes contact with any of the body's surfaces, such as skin, eyes, hair, mucus membranes, etc.
3. **Inhalation**: This poison enters the body when it is inhaled.
4. **Ingestion**: This poison enters the body when it is consumed (ingested).
5. **Wounding**: This poison enters the body through a wound (when HP/SP damage is inflicted).

Poisons with a more dominant modality are ALSO effective when applied through a less dominant route (a contact poison is also effective when inhaled, ingested or enters through a wound).

Poisons with a less dominant modality are not effective when applied through a more dominant route. Thus a wounding poison will not be effective if ingested or inhaled.

#### Affected System
This often determines the effects and what kind of mortals can be affected. For example a poison that affects the nervous system or blood will not affect [plants](10-conditions-types.md#mortals), since they lack these. However, game mechanics generally do not tie this to the poison's function and it is considered flavour related. That said, groups that enjoy "realism" may wish to apply these rules (although it should be done with care if at all!).

#### Effect
Most poisons do some direct poison damage and cause the "poisoned" condition. In addition, poisons can cause direct HP damage, as well as damage to any of the base [stats](02-base-rules.md#stats). Certain poisons may even affect SP/MP dice or seal of supernatural abilities.

___
### Types of Poison
There are different types of poison that generally follow different rules. Poisons can be classified based on these rules. In addition a group may invent new poisons for their settings based on these rules.

#### Necrotising Poisons
This is the type of poison that causes direct degradation of tissues. The most common example is viper venom. Such poisons deal direct damage, and may cause damage to STR and DEX.

#### Nerve Poisons
These poisons affect the nervous system and can have a wide variety of effects. Usually they cause "immobilised"/"paralysed"/"unconscious" but can also cause "catatonic"/"charmed"/"frightened"/"blinded"/"deafened" as well doing damage to INT, WIS and CHA.

#### General Poisons
These poisons generally cause various systems in the body to fail, and can have various effects. The most common are those found in spoilt foods. These can have effects starting from relatively benign such as upset stomachs, ending with full organ failure (and usually death).

#### Spirit Poisons
These poisons affect those parts of a being that interact with, or are, supernatural. They affect MP, MP dice, and the ability to use supernatural abilities. In the worst case they can sever an entity entirely from the supernatural or detach the soul from the body. Such poisons are used by certain fey, fiends and divines.

### Being Poisoned and Cured.
An entity affected by a poison is considered "[poisoned](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail)" and may suffer additional effects. 

When an entity is attacked by poison, it must succeed a CON save vs the poison's threshold, or become poisoned. Entities without a CON score cannot be poisoned.

When an entity recovers from poison, or is otherwise cured, the "poisoned" condition is removed, but additional effects such as damage and secondary conditions are not always removed..

An entity can be cured of poison under one of four conditions:
- The time of action of the poison ends. Unless otherwise stated, a poison's effect lasts for 1 week. After this the poisoned condition is removed, as well as secondary conditions, but not other effects, unless otherwise stated.
- The poisoned entity succeeds on a CON save vs the poisons threshold. Generally this can be repeated once per day. Again, the poisoned condition is removed, as well as secondary conditions, but not other effects, unless otherwise stated.
- Mundane poison can be cured with a "[Heal](05-skills.md#heal)" roll equal to the poison's threshold. Unless otherwise stated, the treatment takes 1 minute and the "poisoned" condition is removed after an hour (as the organism recovers). Unless otherwise stated secondary conditions are also cured, but damage is not.
- Spells such as the "[Cure](08-spell-list.md#cure)" immediately cure the poison, and poisoned condition, but never the secondary affects.

___
### Using Poison
While most venomous/poisonous monsters are naturally (or supernaturally) endowed with poison, characters and NPC must usually obtain this poison and put it to use manually. To prepare a poison for use (apply to a weapon, mix into a meal/drink, burn in an incense burner, etc) a character must succeed on an [academics](05-skills.md#academics) roll using poisoner's tools vs the poison's threshold. This can take between a round and a minute depending on the poison, but is "[1 full round action](04-combat.md#types-of-actions-in-combat)" for wounding poisons, or ingestion poisons in drinks, and 1 minute for all other poisons, unless otherwise stated for a particular poison. The roll is made at disadvantage if the character is not using a poisoner's kit or is not proficient with its use. Furthermore, if a character fails the roll by 6 or more, or with snake-eyes, the one applying the poison, poisons themselves.

#### Applying poisons to weapons
The above rules apply when applying poisons to weapons. It is therefore advisable to apply poisons to weapons before combat to avoid using the first round applying poison. A single application of poison is enough for 20 pieces of ammunition or for 10 **hits** with a melee weapon.

#### Poisons and Shelf-life
Most poisons, like many substances, have a limited shelf-life. Poisons from beasts and monsters generally have a shelf-life of one month if stored properly and 1 hour once applied to a weapon and exposed to air. Poisons of plant origin usually keep for a year and for 1 day once applied to a weapon and exposed to air. Mineral poisons, poisons of draconic origin and supernatural poisons generally keep for centuries.

In most settings, most poisons are not readily available in civilisation, as the authorities of most kingdoms would quite rightly be weary of poisonings and poisoners. However this does not necessarily mean that they cannot be obtained if characters know where to look. The cost of a poison should be based on how difficult it is to obtain and produce, and how effective it is. Thus dragon venom and demon extract would be extremely expensive, while bee venom and viper venom might even be sold legally as a medical ingredient. Broken fairy poison, if at all obtainable, would likely only be available from vile and powerful profane entities (not only does one need to break a fairy, but also harvest the extremely dangerous poison without being affected).

## Diseases
Diseases in FanSys, as in our world, are generally long term conditions that hamper the function of the body and mind. Some are contagious, some are hereditary, some are otherwise acquired. In this chapter we deal both with contagious diseases and those that that can be passed on magically. In general, only mortals suffer from diseases of the body. All entities with free will can suffer from disease of the mind/spirit.

What makes diseases interesting in the sense of the game, is that they spread, therefore a scenario involving a disease there is often a race against time to find the cure, source, or to find a strategy by which it can be contained. Therefore this section also provides suggested doubling time of infected individuals and when (under what conditions) an outbreak of a disease would end without intervention.

____
### Properties of a Disease
Diseases have several properties which define them.
- [Affected Entities](#affected-entities)
- [Diagnosis Threshold](#diagnosis-threshold)
- [Spread Threshold](#spread-threshold)
- [Treatment Threshold](#treatment-threshold)
- [Route of Transmission](#route-of-transmission)
- [Affected System](#affected-system-1)
- [Incubation period](#incubation-period)
- [Duration](#duration-1)
- [Course](#course)
- [Lethality](#lethality)
- [Spread](#spread)

#### Affected Entities
Most diseases can only affect certain species/races/types of entity, others are less selective. For example flu effects humanoids and certain birds, while plague affects mammals in general.

#### Diagnosis Threshold
How difficult it is to diagnose a disease. Some diseases are easy to diagnose (Threshold as low as 8), or particularly difficult (Threshold of over 30). Diagnosing a disease requires a "[Heal](05-skills.md#heal)" roll governed by WIS.

#### Spread Threshold
How easily a disease spreads. This is the threshold against which an entity must make a CON save to avoid being infected.

#### Treatment Threshold
How difficult it is to treat a disease. Often independent of the difficulty of diagnosis. Treatment a disease requires a "[Heal](05-skills.md#heal)" roll governed by DEX or WIS (usually DEX, but can be ruled otherwise by the DM, especially for diseases of the brain, mind and spirit).

#### Route of Transmission
How the disease is transmitted. Unlike poisons, the route of transmission is specific. If a disease is transmitted by multiple routes, they must all be listed. This can be:
- **None**: The disease cannot be passed on, and is essentially a curse.
- **Hereditary**: Transmitted from parent to child.
- **Bodily Fluids**: Bodily fluids of an infected individual must mix with those of potential victims. This only counts for direct exchange of bodily fluids (so mosquito bites, for example, wouldn't count).
- **Bodily Fluids (indirect)**: As spread by "bodily fluids", but also includes old bodily fluids that are taken out the infected individual and later mixed in some form with the bodily fluids of the victim, so these diseases can be spread by tics, mosquitoes, etc. These diseases are particularly contagious in unsanitary conditions.
- **Touch**: These disease are spread by direct contact with the skin/fur/hair of the infected individual.
- **Breath**: These diseases are spread through inhalation of particles exhaled by infected individuals. They are particularly contagious. Usually one has to spend about a minute within 15ft of an infected individual, or of a place where the infected individual has spent at least 10 minutes within the last hour.
- **Mental**: These diseases are spread through the exchange of ideas between infected individual and victim. This applies mostly to diseases of the mind and some supernatural diseases.
- **Perception**: These diseases are spread purely by witnessing them. Mostly applies to supernatural diseases. These diseases can have a catastrophically quick spread. Contrariwise, if they are lethal their outbreaks can be self-limiting (everyone dies).

#### Affected System
Which part of the body/mind the disease affects, this is a flavour aspect and determines what effects it is likely to have:
- **Bones**: Reduced CON, STR, DEX, speed, incapacitating pain, etc.
- **Muscles**: Reduced STR, DEX, speed, etc.
- **Heart/Lungs/Organs**: CON, incapacitation, reduced speed, incapacitating pain, inability to rest, etc.
- **Brain/Mind**: CHA/WIS/INT, loss of proficiencies, loss of memories, reduced speed, paralysis, etc.
- **Spirit**: CHA, loss of proficiencies, inability to use supernatural abilities. Various conditions.

#### Incubation Period
An entity affected by a disease often only develops symptoms after the disease has spread sufficiently through the body and has sufficiently "chipped away" at them. During this period it is incredibly difficult to diagnose a disease, and the diagnosis threshold is increased by 10. During the incubation period an infected entity can spread the disease, but is not otherwise affected.

#### Duration
How long a disease lasts after the incubation period. Some diseases have a set course, and eventually either kill or release their victims. Others are permanent. A large portion of diseases last between a week and a month, although quite a few last longer.

#### Course
This describes how the effects of a disease change from the start to the end of its duration. For some diseases they do not change, for others they do. Likewise most diseases have three possible courses:
- **Asymptotic**: There are no noticeable symptoms. The victim is infectious, but does not suffer from the disease. Diagnosis is as for the [incubation period](#incubation-period).
- **Mild**: The victim suffers only the less serious effects of a disease.
- **Severe**: The victim suffers all of the effects of a disease. Sometimes this includes death.

#### Lethality
The percentage of infected individuals that dies of a disease if it is untreated, and is determined by the "[course](#course)" and "[spread threshold](#spread-threshold)". This is a property used for storytelling, and is there to help a group determine the magnitude of the damage that the outbreak of this or that disease will have on the world. A group can safely ignore this property and make things up to fit the story.

#### Spread
The time needed for the number of infected individuals to double. It is determined by the "[spread threshold](#spread-threshold)" and the "[route of transmission](#route-of-transmission)". As with [lethality](#lethality). This is a property used for storytelling, and is there to help a group determine the magnitude of the damage that the outbreak of this or that disease will have on the world. A group can safely ignore this property and make things up to fit the story.

____
### Catching, Spreading and Curing Diseases
A disease can either be spread magically, (eg the "[Plague](08-spell-list.md#plague)" spell), or by mundane means.

Catching a disease through a spell or supernatural ability is as simple as failing the CON save against the caster's threshold.

In the case of mundane diseases a character must interact with an infected entity in a way that triggers the route of transmission (eg be bitten by a zombie (or kiss a zombie) for zombification, or for a flu, spend time around a character with a flu).

In this case, the character must roll a CON save vs the disease's [Spread Threshold](#spread-threshold). The roll can be declared and then made in secret by the DM for suspense, if the group enjoys that game style.
- If the character succeeds by less than 6, it is infected, but is asymptotic.
- If the character fails by less than 6, it is infected, and the disease runs a mild course.
- If the character fails by 6 or more, it is infected, and the disease runs a severe course.

An infected character might then be able to spread a disease.

To cure a disease, it must be first diagnosed successfully, and then treated.The disease can be cured with a successful heal roll. If the heal roll fails by less than 6, the disease then takes the mild route for the remainder of the duration instead. In this case the victim may attempt a CON save vs the [Treatment Threshold], on a success it is cured.
