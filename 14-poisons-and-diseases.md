This chapter covers the rules for various poisons and diseases. It is not necessary to use these rules, since basic rules on the [poisoned condition](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail) and on [poison damage](10-conditions-types.md#biological-damage) exist. However, for some campaigns, especially those in lower magic settings and campaigns with various forms of intrigue it is useful to have more rules on poison. Likewise, while diseases and plagues can be can be played narratively, rules can serve as a guide as to how they would normally play out.

## Poisons
Poisons are substances that prevent the organisms of mortals from functioning. Some supernatural poisons can even affect [spirits](10-conditions-types.md#spiritual), [divine entities](10-conditions-types.md#divine) or [fiends](10-conditions-types.md#profane). Most, but not all, poisons have a conventional antidote.

___
### Properties of a Poison
Poisons have a several properties that can be described by game mechanics:
- Threshold
- Potency
- Duration
- Mode of Application
- Affected system
- Effect

#### Threshold
How difficult it is to resist the poison's effects. This is the save threshold of the poison.

#### Potency
This is the magnitude of the effect of the poison. In reality, potency can be increased with dose size or by inherent properties of the poison, but the mechanics do not necessarily distinguish between the two.

#### Duration
By default, the conditions caused by a poison last for a week, while damage persists until it is healed by some means (for example by resting). The effects of some poisons (notably food poisoning) last for a day, while the effects of some particularly vile poisons are permanent.

#### Mode of Application
Poisons are generally most effective inside of the body. Some poisons are better at getting inside the body than others. The modes, listed by dominance, are:
1. **Perception**: This poison enters the body as soon as it is perceived with any sense. These poisons are always supernatural and are also effective when MP damage is inflicted.
2. **Contact**: This poison enters the body when it makes contact with any of the body's surfaces, such as skin, eyes, hair, mucus membranes, etc.
3. **Inhalation**: This poison enters the body when it is inhaled.
4. **Ingestion**: This poison enters the body when it is consumed (ingested).
5. **Wounding**: This poison enters the body through a wound (when HP/SP damage is inflicted).

Poisons with a more dominant modality are ALSO effective when applied through a less dominant route (a contact poison is also effective when inhaled, ingested or enters through a wound).

Poisons with a less dominant modality are not effective when applied through a more dominant route. Thus a wounding poison will not be effective if ingested or inhaled.

#### Affected System
This often determines the effects and what kind of mortals can be affected. For example a poison that affects the nervous system or blood will not affect [plants](10-conditions-types.md#mortals), since they lack these. However, game mechanics generally do not tie this to the poison's function and it is considered flavour related. That said, groups that enjoy "realism" may wish to apply these rules (although it should be done with care if at all!).

#### Effect
Most poisons do some direct poison damage and cause the "poisoned" condition. In addition, poisons can cause direct HP damage, as well as damage to any of the base [stats](02-base-rules.md#stats). Certain poisons may even affect SP/MP dice or seal of supernatural abilities.

___
### Types of Poison
There are different types of poison that generally follow different rules. Poisons can be classified based on these rules. In addition a group may invent new poisons for their settings based on these rules.

#### Necrotising Poisons
This is the type of poison that causes direct degradation of tissues. The most common example is viper venom. Such poisons deal direct damage, and may cause damage to STR and DEX.

#### Nerve Poisons
These poisons affect the nervous system and can have a wide variety of effects. Usually they cause "immobilised"/"paralysed"/"unconscious" but can also cause "catatonic"/"charmed"/"frightened"/"blinded"/"deafened" as well doing damage to INT, WIS and CHA.

#### General Poisons
These poisons generally cause various systems in the body to fail, and can have various effects. The most common are those found in spoilt foods. These can have effects starting from relatively benign such as upset stomachs, ending with full organ failure (and usually death).

#### Spirit Poisons
These poisons affect those parts of a being that interact with, or are, supernatural. They affect MP, MP dice, and the ability to use supernatural abilities. In the worst case they can sever an entity entirely from the supernatural or detach the soul from the body. Such poisons are used by certain fey, fiends and divines.

### Being Poisoned and Cured.
An entity affected by a poison is considered "[poisoned](10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail)" and may suffer additional effects. 

When an entity is attacked by poison, it must succeed a CON save vs the poison's threshold, or become poisoned. Entities without a CON score cannot be poisoned.

When an entity recovers from poison, or is otherwise cured, the "poisoned" condition is removed, but additional effects such as damage and secondary conditions are not always removed..

An entity can be cured of poison under one of four conditions:
- The time of action of the poison ends. Unless otherwise stated, a poison's effect lasts for 1 week. After this the poisoned condition is removed, as well as secondary conditions, but not other effects, unless otherwise stated.
- The poisoned entity succeeds on a CON save vs the poisons threshold. Generally this can be repeated once per day. Again, the poisoned condition is removed, as well as secondary conditions, but not other effects, unless otherwise stated.
- Mundane poison can be cured with a "[Heal](05-skills.md#heal)" roll equal to the poison's threshold. Unless otherwise stated, the treatment takes 1 minute and the "poisoned" condition is removed after an hour (as the organism recovers). Unless otherwise stated secondary conditions are also cured, but damage is not.
- Spells such as the "[Cure](08-spell-list.md#cure)" immediately cure the poison, and poisoned condition, but never the secondary affects.

___
### Using Poison
While most venomous/poisonous monsters are naturally (or supernaturally) endowed with poison, characters and NPC must usually obtain this poison and put it to use manually. To prepare a poison for use (apply to a weapon, mix into a meal/drink, burn in an incense burner, etc) a character must succeed on an [academics](05-skills.md#academics) roll using poisoner's tools vs the poison's threshold. This can take between a round and a minute depending on the poison, but is "[1 full round action](04-combat.md#types-of-actions-in-combat)" for wounding poisons, or ingestion poisons in drinks, and 1 minute for all other poisons, unless otherwise stated for a particular poison. The roll is made at disadvantage if the character is not using a poisoner's kit or is not proficient with its use. Furthermore, if a character fails the roll by 6 or more, or with snake-eyes, the one applying the poison, poisons themselves.

#### Applying poisons to weapons
The above rules apply when applying poisons to weapons. It is therefore advisable to apply poisons to weapons before combat to avoid using the first round applying poison. A single application of poison is enough for 20 pieces of ammunition or for 10 **hits** with a melee weapon.

#### Poisons and Shelf-life
Most poisons, like many substances, have a limited shelf-life. Poisons from beasts and monsters generally have a shelf-life of one month if stored properly and 1 hour once applied to a weapon and exposed to air. Poisons of plant origin usually keep for a year and for 1 day once applied to a weapon and exposed to air. Mineral poisons, poisons of draconic origin and supernatural poisons generally keep for centuries.

Multiple applications of this poison do not stack. This is a supernatural poison.|
|Broken Fairy Poison|General|24|Permanent|Perception|A character cannot use supernatural abilities until cured. Likewise it takes 2d6 CHA and 2d6 WIS damage. Multiple applications of this poison do not stack. This is a supernatural poison.|

In most settings, most poisons are not readily available in civilisation, as the authorities of most kingdoms qould quite rightly be weary of poisonings and poisoners. However this does not necessarily mean that they cannot be obtained if characters know where to look. The cost of a poison should be based on how difficult it is to obtain and produce, and how effective it is. Thus dragon venom would be extremely expensive, while bee venom and viper venom might even be sold legally as a medical ingredient.
