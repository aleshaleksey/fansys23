## Foreword
This is a FIRST DRAFT of some general rules. They are over-ruled by more specific rules that pertain to certain creatures and situations. Some rules are prefaced by an ALWAYS or NEVER directive. In these cases they are absolute and apply in all situations. I have used the "advantage" and "disadvantage" in a lot of places in place of "bonus" and "penalty". Take it as a recommendation and not a set rule (since we haven't balanced anything).

### Core Rolls
There are three (and a half) types of base roll.
- An ability/skill roll.
- A save.
- An targeted attack.


#### Version I: 2d12
The core dice for ability checks/tests, saves and attacks is 2D12. You roll a 2D12 and add a static modifier. If the result equals or exceeds a target value, you succeed. Otherwise you fail.
- **General Special**: Also, for every 12 you roll, add +2 to the result. For every 1, subtract 2 from the result.
- **Saves and Attacks**: Also, snake eyes (1,1) always fails. D12 (12,12) always succeeds.
- **Attacks**: Also, or each 12 rolled roll the "damage dice" again and add to total damage.
- **Advantage**: Sometimes circumstances are very favourable. Then you roll 3d12, drop lowest. In extreme cases this can be 4D12DL2.
- **Disadvantage**: Sometimes circumstances are very unfavourable. Then you roll 3d12, drop highest. In extreme cases this can be 4D12DH2.
- Advantage and disadvantage, no matter from how many sources, always cancel each other out.

#### Version II: 1d20
The core dice for ability checks/tests, saves and attacks is the D20. You roll a D20 and add a static modifier. If the result equals or exceeds a target value, you succeed. Otherwise you fail.
- **Saves and attacks**: Also, a 1 is always a failure. A 20 is always a success.
- **Attacks**: Also, on a 20, the damage from "damage dice" is rolled twice.
- **Advantage**: Sometimes circumstances are very favourable. Then you roll 2d20, drop lowest.
- **Disadvantage**: Sometimes circumstances are very unfavourable. Then you roll 2d20, drop highest.
- Advantage and disadvantage, no matter from how many sources, always cancel each other out.

### Time
- 1 day is 24 hours.
- 1 hour is 60 minutes.
- 1 minute is 60 seconds.
- 1 round is 6 seconds (5 works as well but we're more used to the decimal system).

### Entities and Characters
#### General
- Everything is either "**natural**" (that is to say it obeys the physical laws of the world and can be explained by them), or **supernatural** (that is to say that it does not and cannot).
- All entities are either:
 1. **Mortals**.
 2. **Machines**.
 3. **Divine**/**Profane**/**Spiritual** entities.
- Most entities are mortals, including characters. All mortals are alive and can die.
- Machines are not alive and therefore cannot die. They can however be created and destroyed.
- Divine/Profane/Spiritual entities are often not truly alive, and often tend to be eternal. Some are referred to as "gods" or "immortals". This leaves some unanswered questions as to what the rest of them are. Whatever else, they are all **supernatural**.
- In addition creatures fall into other categories that have additional properties and rules pertaining to them.

#### Mortals and Characters
- Unless otherwise stated mortals require "**sustenance**"".
- A mortal that goes without sustenance for a given period of time begins to deteriorate and eventually die.
- A mortal that is deteriorating without sustenance stops deteriorating when sustenance is returned. However if sustenance is withdrawn within a given time period, the deterioration begins immediately.
- The time periods can be modified by various factors. Usually environmental factors.

##### Sustenance for humanoid Characters (and animals)
- This is as follows: (Sustenance kind|duration before deterioration| deterioration name|reset condition|.
 1. **Air** (aerated water for some)|[CON] minutes|suffocation|[10 minutes - CON] with sufficient air.
 2. **Food**|[CONx3] days|starvation|[starvation duration x 2 - CON] days
 3. **Water**|[CON -1] days|dehydration|[2 days]
 4. **Sleep**|[1 day + CHA x hours|insomnia|[7 - CHA] days
- The deterioration behaves as following:
 1. **Suffocation**: Lose 2d6 HP every minute.
 2. **Starvation**: Lose 1 Stamina point/dice per day from your maximum.
 3. **Dehydration**: Lose 1 Stamina point/dice per hour from your maximum.
 4. **Insomnia**: Lose 3 Mana point/dice per day.

#### Conditions and states
Entities can be affected by a number of conditions, most of them bad. For now these include (and all are badly defined!):
- "**Dying**": This creature cannot do anything other than make CON saves or lose 1d6HP per round. It suffers from all the detriments of "Unconscious". If they reach their minus their HP total they die. If they succeed before that. They stop losing HP and become "Unconscious".
- "**Unconscious**": An unconscious character can make CON and CHA saves, and communicate telepathically under certain circumstances. It can take no other actions. In addition it has the following problems:
  - It does not gain [STATS] to AC.

  - All melee attacks are at super-advantage.
  - All damage bypasses SP and MP.
  - It cannot cast or concentrate on spells or take any actions.
  - It cannot perceive the outside world or think rationally.
- "**Helpless**": A helpless character is in a condition where they cannot protect themselves. Usually they are otherwise compromised.

 - It does not gain physical[STATS] to AC.
 - Physical melee attacks against it have super-advantage.
 - It it can fall prone, it falls prone.
 - Physical ranged attacks against it have advantage if it is not prone.
 - Natural damage bypasses SP.
 - It cannot make [STR] or [DEX] saves.
 - It cannot use [SKILLS], attacks or cast spells that require the use of its body (including "incantations" and "somatic components").
 - This means it cannot move.
- "**Crippled**": This character cannot use one or more limbs.
  - Creatures crippled in movement related limbs cannot "run", "sprint" and move at half pace (or "crawl").
  - Creatures crippled in prehensile limbs cannot hold weapons or manipulate objects. They have problems completing "somatic components".
- "**Incapacitated**": This creature cannot take actions (other than movement or communication) or reactions in combat.

 - It has a movement speed of 0ft.
 - It cannot make [DEX] or [STR] saves, attacks.
 - It cannot cast spells with somatic components.
 - Attacks against it have advantage.
 - It cannot use [DEX] and [STR] based skills or abilities except some escape related skills, and even then at super-disadvantage.
- "**Restrained**": A restrained character has problems. It has a movement speed of 0ft and suffers from one or more of the following:
 - It cannot make somatic components for spells.
 - It has disadvantage on physical attacks and [DEX] saves.
 - Attacks against it have advantage.
- "**Grappled**": A grappled character has a movement speed of 0ft.

 - It has disadvantage on melee attacks.
 - It has disadvantage at [STR] and [DEX] saves.
 - It has advantage at skills used in hiding, but may suffer penalties to perception.
- "**Catatonic**": A catatonic character loses the will to act and cannot take actions.
 - It cannot make attacks, use physical abilities or cast spells.
 - It cannot use skills other than those that are involved in perceiving the world.
 - It cannot move.
 - It has disadvantage on all saves.
- "**Stunned**": A stunned character briefly loses control of their body and mind. Stun is a short term effect and ALWAYS provides a [SAVE] every round.
 - It does not gain physical[STATS] to AC.
 - It it can fall prone, it falls prone.
 - Physical attacks against it have advantage (unless the attack is ranged and the character is prone).
 - It cannot make [STR], [DEX] or [CHA] saves.
 - It cannot use [SKILLS], attacks or cast spells that require the use of its body (including "incantations" and "somatic components").
- "**Charmed**": A charmed character cannot attack the source of its charm. It has disadvantage against [WIS], [CHA], [INT] saves vs it. In theory it perceives its words and actions in the most favourable manner. In practice players are players.
- "**Frightened**": A frightened character has disadvantage on to targeted attacks. It must use its movement to move away from the source of its fear.

- "**Invisible**": This character cannot be directly detected by visual means (aka sight). Characters are considered "blinded" in relation to invisible creatures.
- "**Deafened**": A deafened character cannot perceive sound. It cannot hear. It can speak only stutteringly. It must make an [INT] save to complete Incantations (unless it is deaf for longer than month).

### Character Descriptors
A character has descriptive attributes that need not influence mechanics (within reason), eg hair/feather/scale length and colour. Timbre of voice. This kind of thing is cool, but not regulated by these rules.
- A character has an entity type, race, size category, movement modalities and speed. These have mechanistic effects.
 1. **Entity type** define the base possibilities of a character (a plant does not require sleep, but usually requires water, air and "sustenance", it does "see" things. A spirit does not have a corporeal form and cannot be "touched" normally, a humanoid (animal) has a movement speed, and a corporeal form, usually with one head, one torso, two arms and two legs, requires air, water, sustenance, sleep and ages).
 2. The **race** determines some specific characteristics and attributes. (eg base movement speed, movement modality, lifespan, typical weight and height, certain resistances and vulnerabilities and special abilities).
 3. **Size category** [diminutive, tiny, small, medium, large, huge, gargantuan, colossal] affect how much space an entity takes up on (and off) a battlefield, its reach, its AC, and potentially other things.
 4. **Movement modalities** are usually determined by race and special abilities. A creature WITH a movement modality may (or may not!) be able to move over other terrain with an ability check. this is covered in "movement" rules:
   - **walk speed**: ground movement over horizontal-ish terrain.
   - **climb speed**: ground movement over vertical-ish terrain.
   - **flight speed**: areal movement. Movement through the air.
   - **swim speed**: fluid movement.
   - **dig speed**: tunnelling movement.
   - **cosmic speed** ethereal movement. Movement through vacuum, solids (without  interacting) or alternative spaces. Very few beings have a "cosmic speed" and most are supernatural.
   - **blink speed**: discrete movement. An entity with a blink speed need not pass through the spaces between start and destination as long as it is in range. Very few entities have a "blink speed", most are powerful supernatural entities.


- "**Character Level**": All player characters have one. This is an abstract measure of experience and the power that is derived from it. The level determines the proficiency bonus that modifies all rolls. The proficiency bonus is simply derived as [LEVEL / 5] rounded up. For levels 1-5 it is 1, for 5-10 it is 2, etc. **Character level**, together with **stats**, **entity type**, **race**,  forms the "**governing quartet**" which determine most of the base mechanics of a character. Almost all other characteristics can be derived from these four.

- **Stats**: A character has six **base attributes**, also known as "**statistics**" or "**stats**":
 1. **Str**: Physical strength. Upstream of most weapon attack, damage. Upstream of abilities linked to affecting the surroundings by physical force.
 2. **Dex**: Physical agility. Upstream to some weapon attack, damage (usually ranged). Upstream to evasive abilities. Upstream to abilities linked to affecting the surroundings by delicate manipulation.
 3. **Con**: Physical resilience. Upstream of HP, SP, aspects of physical interactions.
 4. **Int**: Mental agility. Ability to memorise, deduce, analyse, IQ. Upstream to skill points, some aspects of supernatural abilities.
 5. **Wis**: Faculty of judgement, discernment, sense, EQ. Upstream of supernatural abilities, abilities devoted to detection, some aspects of social interactions.
 6. **Cha**: Force of Personality. Mental resilience. Upstream of HP, MP, aspects of social interactions.


- **Armour class**: A character has an armour/hit class, this is a measure of how difficult its physical (or spiritual) form is to damage using targeted attacks. It can represent any combination of armour and evasive ability: A targeted attack either hits (potentially doing damage) or it does not.
 1. Base AC is calculated (for now!) as 10+[Static Bonus]+[SP ability bonus]+[MP ability bonus]+[cirumstance bonus]. This has not been decided.
  - Static bonus is some combination of the bonus from armour worn, attributes and passive special abilities.
  - SP ability bonus is the bonus from an active natural ability. Bonuses from different SP abilities do not stack. Only the highest is used.
  - MP ability bonus from active supernatural abilities. As with SP abilities.
  - Circumstance bonus (or penalty!) is how your surroundings and condition affects you. eg. cover, fatigue, etc. Here bonuses stack unless they are from the same source. (eg, you can only have one bonus from cover, you can only have one penalty from viper poison etc.).


- **Saving throws:** Some harmful effects can be negated or mitigated with a "**saving throw**". A character has six saving throws, one for each attribute. Abilities and effects that force a save usually specify one or two valid save types:
 1. **Str**: Use of strength to resist or redirect an effect. This can be voluntarily failed. A "**helpless**" being cannot succeed STR saves. Examples:
   - Use STR to resist being knocked prone by a charging guinea pig.
   - Use STR hang on to a ship's mast when a storm wave washes over a ship.
 2. **Dex**: Use of agility to avoid or redirect an effect. This can be voluntarily failed. An "**immobilised**" being cannot succeed DEX saves. Examples:
   - Use DEX to avoid a charging guinea pig.
   - Defensively tuck in time to avoid the worst of a fireball's heat wave.
 3. **Con**: Use of physical resilience to shake off an effect. This cannot be voluntarily failed. Entities without a physical form ALWAYS succeed CON saves. Examples:
   - Immune system resisting a disease.
   - Resisting a poison.
   - Resisting the effect of a monsters ultrasonic blast.
   - Resisting some supernatural abilities that eat away at the body.
 4. **Int**: Use of analysis to negate a complex effect. This can be voluntarily failed. A mindless being is not affected by abilities that force INT saves. Examples:
   - Negate a confusion effect.
   - Escape a magical labyrinth.
 5. **Wis**: Use of senses to detect an insidious effect. This can be voluntarily failed. A mindless being is not affected by abilities that force WIS saves. Examples:
   - Defeat an illusion.
   - Defeat a charm/fear effect.
 6. **Cha**: Use of force of will/presence to negate an effect. Can sometimes be voluntarily failed.
   - Negate a devil's attempt to cast you into a another plane.
   - Negate a spirit's attempt to devour your essence.
   - Negate possession.


- **Skills**: A character has skills (or at least you'd hope so!). Niall is working on these.


- **Proficiencies**: A character has proficiencies. These are discrete skills where you either know how to use them, or you don't. A character that is not proficient with a thing either can't use it or uses it with a penalty. Allu is working on these.


- **Resource Pools**: A character has resource pools. These are a critical part of the game and are explained below.

#### Resource Pools (VERSION 1)
 1. **HP pool**. This represents your health or life force. Loss of HP represents physical/spiritual damage/degradation.
   - An entity at 1/2 HP gains penalties.
   - An entity at 0 HP is disabled and cannot act.
   - An entity at -HP total is destroyed.
   - A character regains HP on a "long rest" [whatever that may be in duration].
   - A character has maximum HP=CON+CHA+LEVEL.
   - When a character with no SP takes natural damage, it loses HP equal to the damage taken.
   - When a character with no MP takes supernatural damage, it loses HP equal to the damage taken.


  2. **MP pool**. This represents entities' mental energy, it is used when characters use powerful spiritual/mental abilities.
   - Supernatural attacks drain MP before they can degrade HP.
   - A character has up to 3 MP per level + CHA.
   - A character with 0 MP cannot use the more powerful supernatural abilities that require MP.
   - A character regains 1/2 of all MP on any "rest" [whatever that may be in duration].
   - When a character takes supernatural damage it loses 1 MP per 5 points of damage, rounded up.
   - If a character takes more than [CON + 2 x MP total] damage from a single supernatural/mental attack, the remainder is subtracted from HP.


 3. **SP pool**. This represents entities' physical energy, stamina, physical "form".
   - Natural/physical attacks erode SP before they can degrade HP.
   - A character has up to 3 SP per level + CON.
   - A character with 0 SP cannot use the more powerful natural/physical abilities that require SP.
   - A character regains 1/2 of all SP on any "rest" [whatever that may be in duration].
   - When a character takes natural damage it loses 1 SP per 5 points of damage, rounded up.
   - If a character takes more than [CON + 2 x SP total] damage from a single natural/physical attack, the remainder is subtracted from HP.


#### Resource Pools (VERSION 2)
- **HP pool**. See above.


- **MP dice pool**. This is the determinant of "MP pool".
  - A character has a capacity of up to 3 MP dice per level + CHA.
  - A character uses MP dice to fuel powerful mental/spiritual abilities.
  - A character with 0 MP dice cannot use the more powerful supernatural abilities that require MP.
  - A character regains 1/2 of all MP dice on any "rest" [whatever that may be in duration].
- **Mana pool**. This is a measure of an entities' mental/spiritual energy.
  - A character has maximum MP = CHA x LEVEL + [MP dice count] x 2.
  - When a character uses an MP dice, it loses 2 MP.
  - When a character regains an MP dice, it regains 2 MP.
  - When a character takes natural damage it loses 1 MP per point of damage.
  - If a character takes more than [CON + 2 x MP total] damage from a single supernatural/mental attack, the remainder is subtracted from HP.
  - When a character rests, it regains [1/2 x CON x LEVEL] MP.


- **SP dice pool**. This is the determinant of "SP pool".
  - A character has a capacity of up to 3 SP dice per level + CON.
  - A character uses SP dice to fuel powerful physical/natural abilities.
  - A character with 0 MP dice cannot use the more powerful supernatural abilities that require SP.
  - A character regains 1/2 of all SP dice on any "rest" [whatever that may be in duration].
- **Stamina pool**. This is a measure of an entity's physical energy, stamina.
  - A character has maximum SP = CON x LEVEL + [SP dice count] x 2.
  - When a character uses an SP dice, it loses 2 SP.
  - When a character regains an SP dice, it regains 2 SP.
  - When a character takes natural damage it loses 1 SP per point of damage.
  - If a character takes more than [CON + 2 x SP total] damage from a single natural/physical attack, the remainder is subtracted from HP.
  - When a character rests, it regains [1/2 x CON x LEVEL] SP.

#### Bonuses for attack, saves and abilities.
**NB**: This is experimental and probably quite controversial. The idea is to have a class-free Pathfinder style "base attack bonus"-like bonus, but less extreme.

- **Base proficiency bonus (Base)**: This bonus is a modifier added to all attacks and saves. It is determined purely by level.
  - **Base = [LEVEL / 5] rounded up**
  - So at levels 1-5, base=1. At levels 6-10, base=2, at levels 11-15, base=3.


- **Stat Bonus**: For attacks, skills, saves, and often damage, the roll is modified by the **Stat Bonus**, derived from base "stats". This is calculated as follows:
  - **[(STAT - 11) / 2] rounded up**. (this is the same as PF/DnD I think?)
  - Sometimes multiple stats might determine a stat bonus. ALLU IS WORKING ON THIS!


- **Skill points (Skill):** A character gets skill points based on level and intelligence. The maximum number of points in one skill is as follows:
  - **[2 x Base] rounded up**.


- **Natural Bonus (Nat)**: This is a bonus added to all natural/physical attacks, and STR, DEX and CON based saves. It is determined by SP/"SP dice" as follows:
  - **Nat = [SP / 6] rounded down**
  - So a character with 29 "SP dice" has a Nat = 4.


- **Supernatural Bonus (Sup)**: This is a bonus added to all supernatural/magic attacks, and INT, WIS and CHA based saves. It is determined by MP/"MP dice" as follows:
  - **Sup = [MP / 6] rounded down**
  - So a character with 30 "SP dice" has a Nat = 4.


As such the three (and a half) base rolls modifiers are calculated as follows.
- **Skill roll = 2d12 + Base + Skill + Stat + [other factors]**
- **Ability roll = 2d12 + Stat + [other factors]**
- **Save/Attack roll = 2d12 + Base + [Nat] + Stat + [other factors]** (Con, Dex, Str)
- **Save/Attack roll = 2d12 + Base + [Sup] + Stat + [other factors]** (Cha, Int, Wis)


A character does not add their Nat or Sup to saving throws and attacks they are not proficient with. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SAVING THROWS A CHARACTER SHOULD HAVE PROFICIENCY IN BY DEFAULT. But it probably should not be more than 2.

#### Save Difficulty Class
**NB**: This is experimental and probably quite controversial. The idea is to have a class-free Pathfinder style "base attack bonus"-like bonus, but less extreme.

Many phenomena/abilities force a saving throw/roll. We have gone through calculations for saving throws, but what about the value they are rolling against? This is the "Difficulty Class" of the ability.
- For natural abilities this is: **12 + Base + Nat + Stat + [other factors]**
- For supernatural abilities this is: **12 + Base + Sup + Stat + [other factors]**

So for Bob, a 6th level character with an INT of 18 (+4) and 14 "MP Dice" the DC of a supernatural ability could be: 12 + 2(level) + 2(MP dice) + 4(Int) = 20. For Alice, the 5th level character with a WIS of 15 (+2) and 6 "MP Dice", the save bonus would be: 1(level) + 1(MP dice) + 2(WIS) = 4. And she must roll 20 - 4 = 16/24 to pass. Yikes! On the other hand for, for Aerith, a 8th level character with a WIS of 20 (+5) and 19 "MP dice" the save bonus might be 2(level) + 3(dice) + 5(WIS) = 10, so she must roll a 10/24 on the dice. (And this is before we take into account the +2/-2 rule).

### Local and Global Movement.
Here basic movement is described. It is based, where possible on observations. The main forms of movement are walk, climb, swim, flight and dig. Each one has its place and its pace. There are also two exotic types of movement which are not covered yet because we can live without it. Movement is measured in feet per round (ft), or miles per hour (mph). A very rough translation is 1mph = 1ft.

#### Difficult Terrain
It is common when adventuring to find less than ideal terrain. Loose, rocky ground or turbulent waters are typical examples. Movement speed is halved over this kind of terrain. Most creatures cannot "sprint" in these conditions and if they try to run, must make a DC12 [SKILL] check or fail to progress (critical failure means falling prone).

#### Walking
Most creatures with a "walk" speed can:
- **Crawl (5ft/round)**: Crawling is movement when prone, dragging one's torso along the ground. It makes one harder to spot or hit with ranged attacks, but is laborious and slow. Creatures without a "walk" speed can only crawl overland.
- **Walk (1x base speed)**: This either represents ordinary walking, or bursts of rapid movements with pauses and changes of direction. Typically a fit humanoid can walk for hours without suffering ill effects. For a base human this is 30ft or 3mph.
- **Run (2 x base speed)**: This represents a steady jog, a very brisk walk, or rapid movement with obstacles and changes of direction. Typically a humanoid can run for [CON] hours before fatiguing. For a base human this is 60ft or 6mph.
- **Sprint (4 x base speed)**: This represents movement at maximum pace in a fairly straight line, over unbroken terrain free from obstacles. A typical human can sprint for [STR] rounds before becoming fatigued. For a base human this is 120ft or 12mph.
- **Difficult terrain:** Some rocky, overgrown, sloping, slippery terrain is classed as "difficult". Narrow passages also count as difficult terrain.


#### Swimming
Creatures with a swim speed are often well adapted to their liquid medium, but are either incapable of moving on land or very clumsy. Creatures with a swim speed typically have speeds of 60-120ft and can perform "walk", "run" and "spring" actions in their liquid medium (usually water).
- **Not Swimmers:** Creatures without a swim speed either do not swim at all (they sink), or are poor swimmers and can only move at 1/2 base speed (no "run" or "sprint" possible) and must make a [SKILL] or [ABILITY] check or start drowning/sinking if conditions are not ideal.
- **Difficult terrain**: Turbulent waters or strong currents, kelp beds and thick, syrup are examples of difficult terrain.


#### Digging
Moving through solid earth is a slow and difficult process. Moving through rock is often impossible even for diggers. Tunnelling creatures are not slowed by narrow passages. Natural speeds are 5-10ft. Unless otherwise stated Digging creatures cannot dig through solid rock (natural or worked), or metal.
- **Non-diggers**: Creatures that cannot dig cannot move through earth, sand, or rock.
- **Run, Sprint**: Digging creatures cannot run or sprint when digging.


#### Flight
Flight is an intriguing and liberating mode of movements. To terrestrial entities a flying being seems to have the freedom of the wind. Natural flying creatures move between 80-240ft per round.
- **Non-flyers**: Creatures without a fly speed cannot fly. But they can jump.
- **Sprint**: Flying creatures do not sprint.
- **Difficult terrain and falling prone**: Turbulent skies, precipitation and high altitude count as difficult terrain. An flying entity that falls prone is welcomed by the firm embrace of mother earth (it falls).

However this comes with limitations:
- A creatures with natural flight can only fly when carrying a light load and at most light armour.
- They cannot use a shield or heavy weapon and must make concentration checks when casting spells.
- They must have a wing span of at least 1ft per [3lb x Size] of weight. (with size=[1, 2, 3, 4] for ["small", "medium", "large", "huge"] creatures respectively). This has general penalties and in particular this causes penalties on [DEX] and [STR] saves when not in flight, cannot dig and have a penalty to swim and walk speeds.
- If they slow to lower than 1/2 their speed in a given terrain, they must land or fall.

Not all flying creatures are equal in flight. In fact there are four categories:
- **Poor**:
  - These creatures climb at 1/2 speed, cannot "run", cannot ascend/descend at more than 45 degrees.
  -  Their turn radius is equal to 3/2x their fly speed.
  -  They cannot fly for more than [10 minutes x CON] without fatigue.
- **Average**:
  - These creatures climb at 1/2 speed and cannot ascend at more than 45 degrees.
  - Their turning circle is equal to their fly speed.
  - They cannot fly more than [1 hour x CON] without fatigue.
- **Good:**
  - These creatures climb at 1/2 speed.
  - Their turn circle is equal to 1/2x their fly speed.
  - They cannot fly more than [2 hours x CON] without fatigue.
-**Perfect:** These creatures have none of the typical limits of the other three categories. In addition:
  - They can hover without falling.

Most birds are "typical" flyers, though most fowl are "poor" and small raptors are usually "good". Flies, on the other hand have "perfect flight". Humanoids seldom have natural flight. Those that do, are usually poor. Those races with "average" flight pay a high price for it.

##### Walk and Flight Logic
Most terrestrial creatures have legs and walk. Some do not. They slither. They are an exception. We ignore them for now. Using small to large animals for reference, quadrupeds have a walking speed of 2-6 miles per hour (mph), a running speed of 8-20mph, and a sprint pace of 16-40mph. There are fewer bipeds, but they are capable of similar speeds (see ostriches). Humanoids are comparatively slow. 3-4mph (~5-6ft/s) is a typical walk. The fastest sprinter reaches about 24mph (100m/9s, 35ft/s), an average human springs at ~16mph (100m/15s, 24ft/s). The speeds we have quoted in the rules are a bit lower as conditions on an adventure are seldom as ideal as on a modern running track. Likewise you will notice that I have used [STR] for sprinting. This is in keeping with sports physiology.

Most natural flying creatures of tiny to large sizes are fast. Indeed there are fewer flying creatures that can fly slowly than those that can't. Typical cruise speeds of birds are 10-60mph, with maximum speeds being as much as twice as high. On the other hand, flying creatures usually need space to change direction and sacrifice sturdiness for the highly energetic activity of flight. Few flying creatures in the real world weight much more than 10kg.

### Actions in combat
#### Flow of Combat
Combat starts as soon as one or both sides are capable and willing of fighting. It ends when there is only one side remaining that is capable and willing.
- At the start of combat all parties make an initiative roll [check]. Entities act in order of initiative (highest to lowest).
- Combat takes place in "rounds" (~6s) and "turns". Once each combatant has had a "turn", top initiative to bottom, a "round" passes.
- If some potential combatants are unaware of others or of their intent to attack, they start the combat "surprised". A "surprised" entity cannot act in combat and suffers certain penalties. As soon as its first "turn" has passed, it is no longer considered surprised.

#### The Turn
- During its turn an entity may take all of the following actions:
 - One "**move**" action.
 - One "**main action**".
 - One "**secondary action**".
 - One "**minor interaction**".
 - One "**communicate**" action.


- Alternatively an entity may take ONE of the following sets instead:
 - "**Sprint**" action.
 - "**Full round action**" and potentially a "**communicate**" & "**item interaction**" if the full round action is centred around an item.


- In addition, regardless of the other actions, it may take one "**reaction**" at any point in the round, providing that it is not prevented by other factors. It regains its reaction at the start of its turn.

#### Types of actions in combat
The actions an entity may take might also be restricted by its conditions and general limitations. For example, if you have two hands and both are holding swords, you cannot pick up another item with your hand. The following actions exist in combat.
- "**Move**": Move from A to B via a route that its modality of movement permits up to its stated movement speed (eg, talking, peeling a banana, swinging a sword, chewing gum, making the gestures required for casting most spells).
 - Withdrawing without provoking an attack of opportunity is a "move" action.


- "**Main Action**": This is some generalised activity that takes no longer than 6 seconds and does not interfere with general "movement". Actions include:
 - Making an attack action.
 - Using an ability that uses SP or MP.
 - Activating certain items.
 - Using some skills.
 - Take a second "Movement".
 - Administering a potion.
 - Retrieving/Stowing an item that is in a container in reach.


- "**Secondary action**": A minor activity that can be carried out while doing something else at the same time. (eg, Attacking with an offhand dagger while swinging a sword). These include.
  - Attack with an offhand weapon.
  - Use certain abilities that use SP or MP.
  - Activate certain item.
  - Drinking a potion.
  - Picking up, or setting down an item in reach that is not in a container.


- "**Minor interaction**": If an "action" involves using an object, you may carry out an activity associated with that item that involves the part of your form that is interacting it. The creature can also drop ONE item IN ADDITION to this. This need not be the same item. Otherwise these include:
 - Drawing/picking up a sword you are about to attack with.
 - Uncorking a vial before administering the content.


- "**Reaction/Immediate action**": An action that can be taken at any time as long as some trigger condition is fulfilled (usually this requires the entity to be aware that the trigger happens). These actions are generally very quick and can be executed almost reflexively. Eg:
 - Attacking once with a melee weapon or using certain abilities when a creature in range drops their guard (Attack of Opportunity).
 - Cast certain spells or use certain abilities (counter-spelling, parrying, some defensive spells).
 - Dropping to the ground (eg in reaction to the casting of a powerful spell).
 - Dropping an item.


- "**Full round actions**": Certain activities involve using the whole of your turn and cannot fit in an action. They are resolved at the start of the next turn (or a subsequent turn when they are completed. These include:
 - Casting certain spells. Especially those with a casting time of 1 minute or more take multiple full round actions.
 - Using certain mechanisms (eg turning a crank for a mechanism for a drawbridge).


- "**Communicate**": Most entities can communicate in parallel to doing other things. This involves using means of communication (eg Speech) that do not interfere (much!) with other activities. As a guide, a humanoid character can communicate about 1 word per second (6 per round). You cannot use modes of communication that interfere with other actions (eg communicate verbally when chanting an incantation for a spell, using sign-language while wielding a two-handed sword (usually!)).
- "**Sprint**": Move up to 4x your movement speed in a straight line with no obstructions.
- "**Non-action**": Entities also carry out certain activities autonomously as part of their existence. These do not usually require actions (eg breathing). Concentrating is also a non-action.

### Basic combat manoeuvres and tactical movement.
This is a collection of unsorted rules related to basic physical combat.
- Dropping/falling "prone" does not cost movement.
- Standing can be done as part of a "move" action and costs 1/2 your movement speed rounded down.
- Moving out of the threatened area of a foe without precautions provokes an attack of opportunity.
- Moving through a threatened area provokes attacks of opportunity unless the movement is declared as being "cautious", ie at half speed.
- Melee attacks can be made "non lethal" at no penalty with blunt weapons, and at a penalty with sharp weapons.
- Ranged attacks cannot be made non-lethal.
- Supernatural attacks are either non-lethal or not. The caster does not chose.
- In place of a melee attack, a combatant may execute a martial manoeuvre.

#### Basic Martial Manoeuvres.
Any adventurer may attempt a martial manoeuvre. If an untrained combatant attempts this however, they risk attacks of opportunity and other penalties. Many monsters can carry out these manoeuvres without penalties or meeting the prerequisites:
- **Grapple**: Reduce a foe's movement to 0. Requires [SKILL] roll. Penalty if not proficient with hand-to-hand combat. Attack of opportunity on failure.
- **Restrain**: Give a foe extra penalty. Foe must be prone or grappled.  Requires a [SKILL] roll. The one executing this manoeuvre declares one of the desired outcomes:
  - "Silence": Prevent foe from completing incantations.
  - "Restrain": Prevent a foe from casting spells with somatic components and give penalties to weapon attacks.
- **Shove**: Moves a foe away from you by up to 10ft. Requires a [SKILL] roll.
- **Throw**: A different flavour of shove.
- **Trip**: Knock a foe prone. Requires a [SKILL] roll.
- **Disarm**: Liberate a foe of a weapon or item held. Requires a [SKILL] roll. Provokes a penalty and attack of Opportunity if the foe is holding a weapon you are not proficient with.

A creature that is "grappled" or "restrained" can make a check a [SKILL] check in place of its attack action to try to break free or move its assailant.

### Spellcasting and Supernatural abilities
- Abilities and phenomena that would not exist in a mundane world, that cannot be explained adequately by "scientific" means are supernatural, otherwise called magical.
- The supernatural can be caused by divine, profane or spiritual sources.
- Supernatural abilities target MP, are fueled by MP dice.
- Supernatural abilities usually usually force INT, WIS or CHA saves, but some can also force other saves, or be manifest as targeted attacks.

#### Spells
- Spells are a subset of supernatural powers that mortals have learned to channel by following certain procedures.
- Entities that cast spells are referred to here as "**casters**".
- Spells can be either "**common**" or "**global**".
 1. "**Common**" spells have the following properties:
   - They generally take between a couple of seconds to a dozen minutes to cast ("minor action" to "1o minutes"), but generally take a "main action".
   - Their effect is either immediate, or lasts no longer than a few days.
   - Their effect has a range of no more than a mile of a caster.
   - Their effect has a radius of no more than a mile (eg. search spells) or 108ft (eg. explosion magic).
   - They take 1-9 MP dice to cast.
 2. "**Global**" spells have the following properties:
   - Generally take a dozen minutes to a month to cast, but more often an hour or a day.
   - Their effect can be immediate and devastating, or can last for centuries (eg Great Barrier spells).
   - Their range can be hundreds of miles (but is often much shorter).
   - Their effect radius can be hundreds of miles, but is more often localised (eg a Mage's Sanctum).
   - They take at least 10 MP dice to cast, with the usual cost being ~20 dice per day.


- These ALWAYS involve a combination of one or more of the following:
 1. **Somatic Components**: A set of defined, obvious gestures or movements. An "immobilised" or "restrained" caster cannot perform these. (conditions that imply "immobilised" fall under this category).
 2. **Incantation components**: A set of defined, well enunciated words or sounds. A "silenced" or "silent" caster cannot perform these. (conditions that imply inability to produce defined sound fall under this category).
 3. **Ritual components**: A ritual is a procedure involving defined movement and positioning of objects or entities, or the creation of defined patterns. Disruption of this procedure ruins the ritual. Rituals typically apply to global spells.


- Spell ranges are designated as "**melee**" or "**ranged**".
 1. A "**melee**" spell, like a melee attack must requires direct contact between caster and target. Its range is the caster's reach.
 2. A "**ranged**" spell can have a range of 5ft or higher. It is designated as eg "ranged[60ft]". The base distances are 15ft, 30ft, 60ft, 120ft, 240ft.


- An entity can only cast ONE spell at a time. If it attempts to cast a second, either both spells dissipate, or the casting ends in spectacular failure.
- Spells can be **counterspelled** and **dispelled**. (How?)
- Casting non-melee spells with somatic components provokes attacks of opportunity.
- Spells with an active effect (eg summoning) and non-instantaneous duration usually require the caster to maintain their existence by "**concentrating**" on them. This has the following rules:
 1. A caster can NEVER concentrate on more than one spell.
 2. If concentration is broken, the spell dissipates or fails spectacularly.
 3. An "incapacitated" (or so implied) entity cannot concentrate.
 4. Concentration can be disrupted by taking damage (DC10 or 1/2 damage taken, whichever is higher).
 5. Concentration can be disrupted by violent movement (DC10), violent weather (DC10) or both (DC15).
 6. A caster can "hold" an "instantaneous" spell with a release trigger to trigger the effect within a minute of casting. The DC=10+[rounds held]. If the trigger is not met the spell dissipates. The cost of the spell is paid when the spell is cast (always), not when it is triggered.

### Actions outside of Combat
A character should be able to take actions a creature of its type should conceivably be able to take including eat, sleep, explore, and interact with the world.

Some, but not all, of these activities are covered in rules for skill use, research, exploration, resting, crafting, etc. Activities that are not covered by the rules are judged either too hard to cover well within the rules, or too rare in the foreseen use of the game to bother with.

Freeform RP and common sense are recommended.

### Exploration
Exploration and travel is one of the main activities outside of combat and social interactions. When exploring and travelling characters and rules deal with:
- Navigation and getting lost.
- Dealing with environmental hazards.
- Dealing with hazards from other entities and parties.
- Securing resting places, camping and losing things.
- Managing supplies, foraging and starvation.
- Investigating the surroundings and finding places and entities of interest.

The rules should accommodate to all of these activities without trivialising them too much and allowing both success, failure, and forward failure.


#### Falling
A typical humanoid has a terminal velocity of about 100mph, or 1000ft per round. In the first round of falling a falling humanoid falls about 360ft. In most cases they land on the same round. In those cases they have only a "reaction" between them and the swift embrace of the Earth Mother. If the distance exceeds 360ft, they may take other actions, although for the sake of casting spells this counts as vigorous motion. One who falls from the back of a dragon, may have several minutes to contemplate their fate and do something about it.
- Entities of "large" and smaller take 1d8 damage per 10ft fallen. The first 1d8 of damage can be negated with a [SAVE]. This caps at 360ft (36d8), at which point they generally reach terminal velocity.
- "Huge" and larger entities are hated by gravity and take 1d12 damage for every 10ft they fall. They have a higher terminal velocity and also unfavourable physical properties. Sudden drops are not kind to them. The damage also caps at 360ft at (36d12).
- Damage upon "landing" is Physical[Natural] damage. Entities resistant or immune to Physical[Natural] damage need not fear the ground.
- Entities that do not have weight (not mass, weight) do not fall.
