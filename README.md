# Fantasy System (FanSys) / New System for Fantasy Worlds (NSFW)

## About

This system, (provisional name FanSys/NSFW) is an open fantasy gaming system for table top fantasy roleplaying games, inspired by d20 systems like PF v`, DnD 3.5 and 5e, but designed with balance in mind and using 2d12 as the core role.

The system is designed around a [Constitution](constitution.md), which is half way between an actual constitution and a design document. It sets the out the aims of the system, the general principles of the rules and the commandments for making new rules and content. This should hopefully prevent half-elves and reborn dhampire faeries, amongst other horrors of poor game design.

The system is designed to provide a relatively high level of complexity at character creation time, while keeping the intent that "outcomes are decided mostly at play time, not creation time".

## Recommended starting point

The "[Quick Start](quick-start.md)" should be enough to get an idea of the system.

To play it is probably also necessary to read "[Movement and Exploration](movement-exploration.md)" and "[Combat](combat.md)". For character creation "[Skills](skills.md)", "[Abilities](abilities.md)" and the first bit of "[Spellcasting](spells.md)" are also important.

Of course play will be "clunky" if there isn't at least one person at the table who knows the system properly.
