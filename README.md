# Fantasy System (FanSys) / New System for Fantasy Worlds (NSFW)

## About

FanSys/NSFW is a an open fantasy gaming system for table top role-playing games. Its core features are:

- 2d12 as the core roll
- A rules before ruling approach to running the game
- A class-free, ability/skill based level system
- A distinction between real injury (HP damage) and "soft" damage (MP/SP damage).
- A martial combat system that makes actions and manoeuvres beyond "I hit it", viable.
- A focus on the dichotomy between natural and supernatural phenomena.

It is the game system made because I wanted to play it, not because I wanted to "sell" it.

## Recommended starting point

The ["Quick Start"](01-quick-start.md) should be enough to get an idea of the system.

To play it is probably also necessary to read ["Movement and Exploration"](03-movement-exploration.md) and ["Combat"](04-combat.md). For character creation ["Skills"](05-skills.md), ["Abilities"](06-abilities.md) and the first bit of ["Spellcasting"](07-spells.md) are also important.

Of course play will be "clunky" if there isn't at least one person at the table who knows the system properly.

## About the Design of FanSys

FanSys/NSFW is an open fantasy gaming system for table top fantasy role-playing games, inspired to a degree by d20 systems such as PF v1, DnD 3.5 and 5e, but designed with balance in mind and using 2d12 as the core roll.

The design of FanSys is guided by a so called [Constitution](constitution.md), which sets the out the aims of the system, the general principles of the rules and the commandments for making new rules and content. This should hopefully prevent half-elves and reborn dhampire faeries, amongst other horrors of poor game design.

FanSys is designed to provide a relatively high level of complexity at character creation time, while keeping the intent that "outcomes are decided mostly at play time, not creation time".

___
## Version

FanSys is currently a draft set of rules that is quite close to its final form. Nevertheless, the online rules show the very latest "experimental" rules, with previous "snapshots"/versions being kept on the FanSys github (https://github.com/aleshaleksey/fansys23), and will continue to be hosted there for the foreseeable future.

The aim is to reach **v0.1.0**, at which point the rules will become more or less fixed, with the exception of errata which will hopefully be few and far between.

The version currently stands at:

**v0.0.18+**

## Fantasy Committee

There is no dusty cabinet for those of us who dream in the dusty recesses of our mind. However, all those who contributed to the project one way or another, and did not wish to remain hidden, are listed in the "[Fantasy Committee](fantasy-committee.md)".

___
## TODO

- Add magic items to equipment list.
- More monster/NPC stat blocks.
- Playtesting and analysis of balance, especially for spells and abilities.
