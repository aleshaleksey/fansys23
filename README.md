# FanSys

## About

FanSys (provisional name) is an open fantasy gaming system, inspired by d20 systems like PF v`, DnD 3.5 and 5e, but designed with balance in mind.

The system is designed around a [Constitution](constitution.md), which is half way between an actual constitution and a design document.
