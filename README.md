# FanSys

## About

FanSys (provisional name) is an open fantasy gaming system, inspired by d20 systems like PF v`, DnD 3.5 and 5e, but designed with balance in mind.

The system is designed around a [Constitution](constitution.md), which is half way between an actual constitution and a design document. It sets the out the aims of the system, the general principles of the rules and the commandments for making new rules and content. This should hopefully prevent half-elves and reborn dhampir faeries, amongst other horrors of poor game design.
