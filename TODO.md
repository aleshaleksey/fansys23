## Races
- Better wording on total number of skill and skill adjustments in [races](races.md).
- Template levels should start at level 1 [races](races.md).
- Make lists alphabetical EVERYWHERE.
- [Size rules](base-rules.md#size-rules). Add explanation of how zero-reach works. Also add link to size rules in the quick start.
- Better rules for abilities (in the race abilities): For heat sense and tremor sense. NB!! Difference between templates on races page and quick-start page.

## Combat
- Better define what resistance to a condition is (aka advantage), also capitalise. ([Races](races.md), [Conditions and Types](conditions-types.md))
