# Abilities and Boons

Abilities are special actions that a character can take outside of the core actions available to all characters (covered in "Combat", "Movement and Exploration", and "Skills"). Abilities are often more potent than the core actions, but these also come at a cost of consuming SP dice and MP dice, so use them with care. Importantly, magic is covered at the end of this chapter.

Boons are traits that enhance a character beyond what it would otherwise be. For example, a boon might grant resistance to "bludgeoning" damage, or allow a character to move faster, or breath under water, or attack more than once during a "main action".

Each category is split up into "combat", "exploration" or "general". The categories are not perfect but they cover most bases relatively well.

## Prerequisites

Some abilities and boons have prerequisites. These are there to balance the game, but also to make sense: How does one learn an advanced ability when one does not know the basics? A character that loses a prerequisite for an ability or boon cannot use the ability or boon until that prerequisite is restored.

The most common prerequisites are a minimum [Base], a minimum level, or a minimum total of SP or MP dice.

## Max dice per level

For combat and general abilities the number of dice used per single ability is equal to half the character's level rounded up. For global magic there is no limit.

## Rating

All abilities and boons are rated "C" through "S" class. "C" is considered 'weakest', while 'S' is considered strongest (although this does not necessarily determine general usefulness). This is used mostly for the creation of templates, but also as a guideline for determining prerequisites.

## Abilities

### Declaration

Unless otherwise stated an ability must be declared and any cost paid upfront before any rolls are made.
