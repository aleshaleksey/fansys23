**Abilities** are special actions that a character can take outside of the core actions available to all characters (covered in "Combat", "Movement and Exploration", and "Skills"). Abilities are often more potent than the core actions, but these also come at a cost of consuming SP dice and MP dice, so use them with care. Importantly, magic is covered at the end of this chapter.

**Boons** are traits that enhance a character beyond what it would otherwise be. For example, a boon might grant resistance to "bludgeoning" damage, or allow a character to move faster, or breath under water, or attack more than once during a "main action".

The line between "boons" and "abilities" is a fine one, but in general "abilities" are something that is actively used, (eg, "I use elemental touch", "I use far throw"), while a boon is something that is used passively (eg "I have skirmisher so I move behind the enemy where I am flanking and you don't get an attack of opportunity."). 

Each category is split up into "combat", "exploration" or "general". The categories are not perfect but they cover most bases relatively well.

## Prerequisites

Some abilities and boons have prerequisites. These are there to balance the game, but also to make sense: How does one learn an advanced ability when one does not know the basics? A character that loses a prerequisite for an ability or boon cannot use the ability or boon until that prerequisite is restored.

The most common prerequisites are a minimum [Base], a minimum level, or a minimum total of SP or MP dice.

## Max dice per level

For combat and general abilities the number of dice used per single ability is equal to half the character's level rounded up. For global magic there is no limit.

## Rating

All abilities and boons are rated "C" through "S" class. "C" is considered 'weakest', while 'S' is considered strongest (although this does not necessarily determine general usefulness). This is used mostly for the creation of templates, but also as a guideline for determining prerequisites.

## Abilities

### Declaration

Unless otherwise stated an ability must be declared and any cost paid upfront before any rolls are made.

**Offence**:
- Exertion: Yes.
- Range: Weapon range, but no more than 30ft + 5ft/[assassinate level]
- Duration: Instantaneous.
- Action: "main action".
- Target: 1.
- Attack: Weapon attack.
- Damage: Weapon damage (directly vs HP).
- Dice: None.

**Prerequisites**:
- Precision attack III.
- Character level of at least [Assassinate level] x 4

**Special**:
- You can only make one attack as your main action when using "assassinate".
- The target must affected by at least one of the conditions that your assassinate level qualifies you for. For example at "Assassinate I", it must be "immobilised", at "Assassinate 3" it must be "immobilised", or "surprised" or "stunned".
- Assassinate automatically fails if the target has heavy or total concealment, or if it is "invisible" to you.
- Since it uses a "main action" it cannot be used as a "reaction".
- You cannot use "assassinate" when in conjunction wit "Berserk" and similar abilities.

|Assassinate level|Exploited Condition|Minimum Level|
|-|-|-|

In addition the character has a bonus to walk, climb, swim and fly speed, weapon damage, and may have advantage on attacks.

**Special**:
- Berserk does not have an SP dice cost. However, when the berserker trance is over, you lose a number of HP equal to the level of the Berserk ability (so if you have "Berserk I" you lose 1HP).
- While "berserk", a character may not use Int based skills and has disadvantage on all Wis and Cha based skills while Berserk. It has disadvantage on "Tinker" rolls.
- While "berserk", a character cannot cast spells with a kinetic component and must roll a 1d6 when trying to cast spells with an incantation, losing the spell on a 3 or lower.
- While "berserk", a character may not use abilities such as "precision attack".

#### Bind Beast I-X

**Type**: A Class (I-V), S Class (VI-X).

**Description**: Bind an "animal" or "monster" to accompany and serve you. Mystics often use bound monsters as guardians.

**Action:**
- Exertion: Yes.
- Range: 30ft.
- Duration: Instantaneous.
- Action: 1 hour ritual.
- Target: A single "animal" or "monster" which must remain within 30ft of you for the duration of the ritual.
- Attack: None
- Damage: None
- Cost: 1 MP dice per level of beast.

**Benefits**: A bound beast may not disobey you and acts as a loyal servant, this does not mean, however that it necessarily likes it.
- A bound beast understands your commands and can be commanded in and out of battle with a "communicate" action. No "creature handling" check is required.
- Such a beast can be used for combat, scouting, guarding and other menial tasks within its capability.

**Limitations**:
- You must find a suitable beast and keep it still for long enough to bind it. It can attempt a Cha save vs your [SAP + [Cha]] to not be bound. You cannot attempt to bind the same beast for a month if it succeeds. If it succeeds three times, you can never bind it.
- If a beast has a higher level than your "Bind Beast" limit, you cannot bind it.
- If you do something, or order the beast to do something that would normally make it a "nemesis" (see "[Skills: Persuade](skills.md#persuade)"), it gets a Cha save vs your [SAP + [Cha]] at advantage to break the binding.
- You can never have more than one bound beast at a time.
- You must sacrifice 1HP of your own per 2 levels of "bind beast" to the beast every day to keep it bound (min 1). Sacrificing another's HP transfers the beast to their control for the day: Every day this is done the beast gets a Cha save vs the temporary master's [SAP + [Cha]] to break free.

**Rules**:
- If the beast's attack, damage dice, HP, SP or MP are greater than the values displayed on the table, they are reduced to that value.
- If the beast's attack, damage dice, HP, SP or MP are lower than 3/4 of the values displayed on the table, they are increased to 3/4 of the value.
- If its movement modalities are too high, it looses them until your "Bind Beast" level reaches a point where it is high enough. If the beast does not have these modalities, it does NOT gain them.
- The beast retains its HiT and uses your base save bonuses.
- The beast loses all abilities that exceed the max permitted class.
- The beast may serve as a mount if it can carry you.

**Prerequisite**: You must have at least one level of "global" or "incantation" magic to gain this ability.

|Ability Level|Min Level|Dmg. dice|Attack bonus|HP|SP|MP|Permitted class|Modalities|

### Spellcasting

Spell casting abilities come in two flavour: Local and Global. Local spellcasting covers spells which take no longer than an hour to cast, have effects that wear off in a month of less and do not reach further than a mile from the point of casting. They are most useful in battle and situations where an immediate effect is needed. Global spellcasting covers everything else and is used in various applications, from near impenetrable barrier on holy sites, to enchantments that bring fertile harvests to whole kingdoms over the centuries.

The rules for use of spells in combat are found in "[Combat: Spells](combat.md#spells)".

Other magic rules, including spell lists are found in "[Spells](spells.md)"

#### Spellcasting: Local

There are several forms of spellcasting in this category, but they all have similar mechanics and have the same prerequisites. The casting types in this category are:

- Elemental: Air
- Elemental: Earth
- Elemental: Fire
- Elemental: Ice
- Incantation
- Kinetic
- Nature

**Special**:
- Each time a character wishes to learn the new category of local magic, they must take it as a separate ability.
- Each type of local magic also covers some global spells. As long a character has "Spellcasting: Global I" and the requisite level of local spellcasting of the type, they can cast global spells of that type and level.
- In order to get the next level of a type of local magic, a character must have the previous one. So if a character wishes to learn "Spellcasting: Nature III", they must have "Spellcasting: Nature II", which requires having "Spellcasting: Nature I".
- A spellcaster can never channel more than 1/3 of their MP dice total into a single "local" spell.

**Local Spellcasting table**:

|Ability level|MP dice casting cost|MP dice prerequisite|Level Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|1|3|1|
|II|2|6|3|
|III|3|9|5|
|IV|4|12|7|
|V|5|20|9|
|VI|6|24|11|
|VII|7|28|13|
|VIII|8|32|15|
|IX|9|36|17|
|X|10|40|19|

#### Spellcasting: Global

Global magic covers the casting of all global spells. In order to access and cast global spells of a certain type and level a character must have either of:

1. The requisite level in that type of local magic and 1 level of global magic.
2. The requisite level of global magic and 1 level in that type of local magic.

So for example, to cast global 7th level Nature magic, a character must have either "Spellcasting: Nature VII" and "Spellcasting: Global I", or "Spellcasting: Global VII" and "Spellcasting: Nature I".

**Casting time and cost**: Global spells take at least an hour to cast, but more often the casting time is measured in days or weeks. Thus the MP dice cost is measured in "dice per day".

**Global Spellcasting table**:

|Ability level|MP dice casting cost per day of casting|MP dice prerequisite|Level Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|3|3|1|
|II|6|6|3|
|III|9|9|5|
|IV|12|12|7|
|V|15|20|9|
|VI|18|24|11|
|VII|21|28|13|
|VIII|24|32|15|
|IX|27|36|17|
|X|30|40|19|

**Type**: (Natural/Supernatural, Class A-C)

**Prerequisite:** Xenophonia of various types can be taken in any order, but prerequisites must be obeyed. For example to take xenophonia(undead), a character must be at least level 6, or to take xenophonia(animals) a character must be level 2. On the other hand to take Xenophonia(Fey) a character must be at least level 6 and have at least one other xenophonia, though it can be *any* type, so for example a level 6 character with xenophonia(animal), or a level 7 character with xenophonia(elemental) can both take xenophonia(fey). 

|Entity sub-type|Level Prerequisite|Other|Nature of Ability
|-|-|-|-|
|Animal|4|-|Natural/Supernatural (chose)|
|Plant|4|Xenophonia I|Natural/Supernatural (chose)|

|Spirit|8|-|Supernatural|
|Dragon|10|Xenophonia II|Supernatural|
|Angel|12|Xenophonia III|Supernatural|
|Fiend|12|Xenophonia III|Supernatural|

**Special**
- Even if you can communicate through xenophonia with beings of other types using signals that they understand, the content of your communication may still be incomprehensible to them due to alien minds, incompatible conceptual frameworks or limited intellectual capacity. For example, the concept of death may be alien to certain spirits, while a plant may not have the ability to count, while a hedgehog might not know what a steam train is.
- Characters with "xenophonia" can never use the ability to understand "glitches" and "divines".
- A character may only take one type of "xenophonia" per level.
