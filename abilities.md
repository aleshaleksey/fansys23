# Abilities and Boons

**Abilities** are special actions that a character can take outside of the core actions available to all characters (covered in "Combat", "Movement and Exploration", and "Skills"). Abilities are often more potent than the core actions, but these also come at a cost of consuming SP dice and MP dice, so use them with care. Importantly, magic is covered at the end of this chapter.

**Boons** are traits that enhance a character beyond what it would otherwise be. For example, a boon might grant resistance to "bludgeoning" damage, or allow a character to move faster, or breath under water, or attack more than once during a "main action".

The line between "boons" and "abilities" is a fine one, but in general "abilities" are something that is actively used, (eg, "I use elemental touch", "I use far throw"), while a boon is something that is used passively (eg "I have skirmisher so I move behind the enemy where I am flanking and you don't get an attack of opportunity."). 

Each category is split up into "combat", "exploration" or "general". The categories are not perfect but they cover most bases relatively well.

## Prerequisites

Some abilities and boons have prerequisites. These are there to balance the game, but also to make sense: How does one learn an advanced ability when one does not know the basics? A character that loses a prerequisite for an ability or boon cannot use the ability or boon until that prerequisite is restored.

The most common prerequisites are a minimum [Base], a minimum level, or a minimum total of SP or MP dice.

## Max dice per level

For combat and general abilities the number of dice used per single ability is equal to half the character's level rounded up. For global magic there is no limit.

## Rating

All abilities and boons are rated "C" through "S" class. "C" is considered 'weakest', while 'S' is considered strongest (although this does not necessarily determine general usefulness). This is used mostly for the creation of templates, but also as a guideline for determining prerequisites.

## Abilities

### Declaration

Unless otherwise stated an ability must be declared and any cost paid upfront before any rolls are made.

- Target: A single "animal" or "monster" which must remain within 30ft of you for the duration of the ritual.

- Such a beast can be used for combat, scouting, guarding and other menial tasks within its capability.

**Limitations**:
- You must find a suitable beast and keep it still for long enough to bind it. It can attempt a Cha save vs your [SAP + [Cha]] to not be bound. You cannot attempt to bind the same beast for a month if it succeeds. If it succeeds three times, you can never bind it.
- If a beast has a higher level than your "Bind Beast" limit, you cannot bind it.
- If you do something, or order the beast to do something that would normally make it a "nemesis" (see "[Skills: Persuade](skills.md#persuade)"), it gets a Cha save vs your [SAP + [Cha]] at advantage to break the binding.
- You can never have more than one bound beast at a time.
- You must sacrifice 1HP of your own per 2 levels of "bind beast" to the beast every day to keep it bound (min 1). Sacrificing another's HP transfers the beast to their control for the day: Every day this is done the beast gets a Cha save vs the temporary master's [SAP + [Cha]] to break free.

- If the beast's attack, damage dice, HP, SP or MP are lower than 3/4 of the values displayed on the table, they are increased to 3/4 of the value.
- If its movement modalities are too high, it looses them until your "Bind Beast" level reaches a point where it is high enough. If the beast does not have these modalities, it does NOT gain them.
- The beast retains its HiT and uses your base save bonuses.
- The beast loses all abilities that exceed the max permitted class.
- The beast may serve as a mount if it can carry you.

**Prerequisite**: You must have at least one level of "global" or "incantation" magic to gain this ability.
