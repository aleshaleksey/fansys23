## Types

### Natural and supernatural origins

Most entities and phenomena in the game are classified ad **natural**/**mundane** or **supernatural**. "Natural" implies that it generally obeys the laws of logic, mathematics, physics and other natural laws. "Supernatural" implies the fantastic that it does not (although it must obey game mechanics, so it clearly obeys some form of logic). A normal house is "natural"/"mundane", but a house possessed by a hungry demon is most certainly "supernatural" (at least until someone gets rid of the demon). The "supernatural" includes gods, spirits, magic and much more.

Often supernatural entities are not effected by "natural" attacks, or have a resistance to them and have abilities that defy reason and bypass mundane, "natural" defences.

Most characters are fundamentally "natural", but possesses some "supernatural" abilities and traits. "Natural" damage is first at least partially by an entity's SP, before before affecting HP. It generally affects the physical form. "Supernatural" damage is first buffered, at least in part, by an entity's MP, before affecting HP. It affects an entity's essence or spirit.

This is an important factor both in building a character and playing it.

### Damage types

All damage is deduced from current HPs. HPs are protected from Nar damage by SP and by Sup damage by MP. An entity's MP/SP can absorb a certain amount of damage and deducing from current MP/SP total, with any excess damage counting against HP. When an entity reaches 0 HP it is dying. Some damage types ignore MP/SP. They are particularly dangerous.

All damage types have associated conditions. If an entity takes damage to HP greater than its level, it must make a Con or Cha save against threshold of [10 + HP damage / 2] or suffer a condition on the attack's list, starting from the lowest class condition. If it is already suffering from it, or is immune to it, it adds the next lowest condition to its conditions. If all conditions are added, nothing more happens.

#### Physical damage

Physical damage destroys the physical structure of a target by direct application of physical force. Weapon damage is almost always physical damage. Entities without a physical form are ALWAYS immune to physical damage. Entities with a supernatural form may also be immune to physical damage (eg spirits).

**Piercing** damage is typically caused by teeth and pointy weapons and projectiles. It involves the concentration of force at a small point (pressure), which results in deep penetration of the target along a line. Soft targets with and without a hard shell are typically susceptible to this kind of damage. It seldom causes conditions.

**Slashing** damage is typically caused by claws and bladed weapons. It involves the physical splitting of two parts of a target by application of concentrated force along a plane (a cut). Soft targets are particularly susceptible to slashing damage. Slashing damage typically causes the "bleeding" or "crippled" condition.

**Bludgeoning** damage is typically caused by heavy objects with a lot of momentum. It involves the rapid transfer of physical force over a large area, causing brittle materials to break, and pressure sensitive materials to rupture. Targets of a brittle material are particularly susceptible to this damage type. This kind of damage can cause a target to be knocked "prone" or "cripple" it.

**Shear** damage is caused when a target is torn apart. Targets of low tensile materials, such as humanoids and animals are particularly susceptible to this damage type. It typically causes the "crippled" condition.

**Pressure** damaged is usually caused by shock waves and special techniques designed to transfer force deep into a target. Much like bludgeoning damage it ruptures pressure sensitive internal structures and can fracture very brittle materials. Targets with internal organs are particularly susceptible to this form of damage. This dangerous form of damage typically causes the "stunned", "frightened", "prone" or "incapacitated"  condition.

#### Biological damage

Destroys the biological structure or physiological function of plants, animals, humanoids, monsters and dragons. Entities without a physical form, biological structure or functioning physiology are generally immune to this kind of damage (eg, skeletons, constructs).

**Poison** damage is caused by substances and energies that directly interfere with biological function, often with grizzly and devastating effects. Poisons always cause the "poisoned" condition, but can also cause any S class condition, and most other conditions. It is the single most dangerous form of damage to humanoids and animals (just ask the giant scorpion).

**Necrotic** damage is caused by substances and energies that destroy biological structures, often causing grizzly "bleeding", "disease", "blinded", "crippled" and a number of other unpleasant conditions. This damage type can affect corporeal undead since they have a biological body.

#### Energy/elemental damage

Energy damage is caused by various forms of energy and can affect anything with a physical form. Energies of a supernatural source can affect incorporeal entities.

**Heat (fire)** damage is caused by the heating of materials, and their subsequent oxidation causing it to become too frail to maintain its form and function (at least "natural" fire does). 'Supernatural" burns away the essence. This damage is particularly effective against biological and flammable targets. It can cause "incapacitated" (pain) or "blinded" (permanent) condition. Heat also tends to travel "upwards" and should not be underestimated!

**Cold (ice)** damage is caused a reduction of energy level in the substance of the target, often causing it to lose physical function, become brittle, or even freeze. Cold damage causes dangerous conditions like "immobilised" (frozen) and "incapacitated" (hypothermic).

**Electricity (lightning)** damage is caused by a rapid flow of charge through a target which generally causes internal heat-like damage and particularly damages nerves and control systems. Supernatural lightning is often used by divine beings. Lightning is particularly effective against mortals and constructs. It can cause dangerous conditions like "paralysed", "immobilised", "incapacitated" and "stunned".

**Light** damage can be caused by intense light, which can ablate both surface and deep layers of an entity. Natural light is often effective against monsters and undead. Supernatural light is particularly effective against spiritual and profane beings. It tends to cause "frightened", "blinded", "catatonic" and "incapacitated".

#### Esoteric damage 

Esoteric damage is caused by, typically powerful, supernatural beings. It typically affects either the spirit or essence of an entity. Esoteric damage cannot exist in a world without the "supernatural". These three damage types are particularly dangerous because they ignore the SP and MP of entities that are not divine.

**Divine** damage directly eliminates a target's spiritual essence. Targets without spirit (mainly objects) are not affected by this damage type. Profane beings and mortals are particularly vulnerable to it. Divine damage typically causes "unconscious", "catatonic", "immobilised", "incapacitated", "aphonia", "blinded" or "frightened". Beware the wrath of the gods.

**Entropic** damage prevents the laws of creation from functioning, causing physical targets to disintegrate or mutate horribly, while spiritual targets are rendered down to pure energy. Typically this damage type causes "crippled", "incapacitated" or "bleeding".

**Profane** damage is caused exclusively by profane entities. It is the destruction of goodness and vital energies, as well as the draining of spiritual energy. Constructs and undead are the only entities that are safe from this damage type. It typically causes "dying", "paralysed", "immobilised", "restrained", "aphonia", "frightened" and "charmed".

### Entity types

- Everything is either "**natural**" (that is to say it obeys the physical laws of the world and can be explained by them), or **supernatural** (that is to say that it does not and cannot).
- All entities are either:
  1. **Mortals**.
  2. **Machines**.
  3. **Divine**/**Profane**/**Spiritual** entities.
- Most entities are mortals, including characters. All mortals are alive and can die.
- Machines are not alive and therefore cannot die. They can however be created and destroyed.
- Divine/Profane/Spiritual entities are often not truly alive, and often tend to be eternal. Some are referred to as "gods" or "immortals". This leaves some unanswered questions as to what the rest of them are. Whatever else, they are all **supernatural**.
- In addition creatures fall into other categories that have additional properties and rules pertaining to them.
- There are more types of "supernatural" entity, but most entities a character is likely to encounter are probably "natural".
- Entity types include:
  - **Mortals**
    - **animal** (Nat)
    - **humanoid** (Nat or Sup)
    - **monster** (Nat or Sup)
    - **plant** (Nat or Sup)
    - **dragon** (Sup)
  - **Constructs**
    - **robot** (Nat)
    - **golem** (Sup)
  - **Divine**
    - **angel** (Sup)
    - **glitch** (Sup)
    - **divine** (Nat and/or Sup)
  - **Spiritual**
    - **fey** (Sup)
    - **spirit** (Sup)
    - **elemental** (Sup)
  - **Profane**
    - **fiend** (Sup)
    - **undead** (Sup)
