## Types

### Natural and supernatural origins

Most entities and phenomena in the game are classified as **natural**/**mundane** (Nat) or **supernatural** (Sup). "Natural" implies that it generally obeys the laws of logic, mathematics, physics and other natural laws. "Supernatural" implies the fantastic that it does not (although it must obey game mechanics, so it clearly obeys some form of logic). A normal house is "natural"/"mundane", but a house possessed by a hungry demon is most certainly "supernatural" (at least until someone gets rid of the demon). The "supernatural" includes gods, spirits, magic and much more.

Often supernatural entities are not effected by "natural" attacks, or have a resistance to them and have abilities that defy reason and bypass mundane, "natural" defences.

Most characters are fundamentally "natural", but possesses some "supernatural" abilities and traits. This is an important factor both in building a character and playing it.

___
#### Natural and Supernatural damage and abilities

Damage can be either Nat or Sup. Nat damage first affects the target's SP, being at least partially absorbed, before before affecting HP. It generally affects the physical form. Sup damage is first buffered, at least in part, by an entity's MP, before affecting HP. It affects an entity's essence or spirit. Thus if an entity takes 10 "fire"[Sup] damage, the first, say, 7 points may be absorbed by MP, with the remaining 3 points doing HP damage. The exact calculation for maximum Nat damage absorbed by SP is [CON + 2 x SP dice total], and is symmetrical for MP and Sup (see "[Resource Pools](base-rules.md#resource-pools)" section).

Damage caused by mundane or martial abilities is Nat, unless the ability is very powerful, at which it may become Sup. Damage caused by magic, spells and other supernatural abilities is usually Sup, but may also be Nat on occasion.

Some types of damage bypass both MP and SP, and attack HP directly. Entities that possess abilities that inflict these types of damage are extremely dangerous.

Nat abilities are fueled by SP dice. Sup damage is fueled by MP dice.

___
#### Mundane, magical and spiritual weapons

Weapons can be mundane, magical or spiritual.
- A mundane weapon deals "physical"[Nat] damage, attacking SP and then HP.
- A magical weapon deals "physical"[Nat] damage, attacking SP and then HP, but overcomes resistance, but not immunity to physical damage. These weapons are useful for fighting monsters and dragons and should be rare and expensive in any sane setting.
- A spiritual weapon may (or may not) appear ordinary, but deals "divine"[Sup] damage. As an exception to normal "divine" damage rules, these weapons attack MP and then HP. Spiritual weapons should be exceptionally rare.

___
### Damage types

All damage is deduced from current HP. HP are protected from Nat damage by SP and by MP against Sup damage. An entity's MP/SP can absorb a certain amount of damage and deducing from current MP/SP total, with any excess damage counting against HP. When an entity reaches 0 HP it is "dying". Some damage types ignore MP/SP. They are particularly dangerous.

All damage types have associated conditions. If an entity takes damage to HP greater than its level, it must make a Con or Cha save against threshold of [10 + HP damage / 2] or suffer a condition on the attack's list, starting from the lowest class condition. If it is already suffering from it, or is immune to it, it adds the next lowest condition to its conditions. If all conditions are added, nothing more happens.

___
#### Physical damage

Physical damage destroys the physical structure of a target by direct application of physical force. Weapon damage is almost always physical damage. Entities without a physical form are ALWAYS immune to physical damage. Entities with a supernatural form may also be immune to physical damage (eg spirits).

**Piercing** damage is typically caused by teeth and pointy weapons and projectiles. It involves the concentration of force at a small point (pressure), which results in deep penetration of the target along a line. Soft targets with and without a hard shell are typically susceptible to this kind of damage. It can cause the "bleeding" condition.

**Slashing** damage is typically caused by bladed weapons or sharp claws. It involves the physical splitting of two parts of a target by application of concentrated force along a plane (a cut). Soft targets are particularly susceptible to slashing damage. Slashing damage typically causes the "bleeding" or "crippled" condition.

**Bludgeoning** damage is typically caused by heavy objects with a lot of momentum. It involves the rapid transfer of physical force over a large area, causing brittle materials to break, and pressure sensitive materials to rupture. Targets of a brittle material are particularly susceptible to this damage type. This kind of damage can cause a target to be knocked "prone" or "cripple" it.

**Shear** damage is caused when a target is torn apart, for example by a bear's claws. Targets of low tensile materials, such as humanoids and animals are particularly susceptible to this damage type. It typically causes the "crippled" condition.

**Pressure** damaged is usually caused by shock waves and special techniques designed to transfer force deep into a target. Much like bludgeoning damage it ruptures pressure sensitive internal structures and can fracture very brittle materials. Targets with internal organs are particularly susceptible to this form of damage. This dangerous form of damage typically causes the "stunned", "frightened", "prone" or "incapacitated"  condition.

___
#### Biological damage

Destroys the biological structure or physiological function of plants, animals, humanoids, monsters and dragons. Entities without a physical form, biological structure or functioning physiology are generally immune to this kind of damage (eg, skeletons, constructs).

**Poison** damage is caused by substances and energies that directly interfere with biological function, often with grizzly and devastating effects. Poisons always cause the "poisoned" condition, but can also cause any S class condition, and most other conditions. It is the single most dangerous form of damage to humanoids and animals (just ask the giant scorpion).

**Necrotic** damage is caused by substances and energies that destroy biological structures, often causing grizzly "bleeding", "disease", "blinded", "crippled" and a number of other unpleasant conditions. This damage type can affect corporeal undead since they have a biological body.

___
#### Energy/elemental damage

Energy damage is caused by various forms of energy and can affect anything with a physical form. Energies of a supernatural source, can affect incorporeal entities.

**Heat (fire)** damage is caused by the heating of a material, and its subsequent oxidation, which causes it to become too frail to maintain its form and function (at least "natural" fire does). "Supernatural" fire burns away the essence. This damage is particularly effective against biological and flammable targets. It can cause "incapacitated" (pain) or "blinded" (permanent) condition. Flammable materials ignite when dealt at least 10 points of heat damage. Highly flammable materials ignite when dealt any heat damage. Heat also tends to travel "upwards" and should not be underestimated!

**Cold (ice)** damage is caused a reduction of energy level in the substance of the target, often causing it to lose physical function, become brittle, or even freeze. Cold damage causes dangerous conditions like "immobilised" (frozen) and "incapacitated" (hypothermic).

**Electricity (lightning)** damage is caused by a rapid flow of charge through a target which generally causes internal heat-like damage and particularly damages nerves and control systems. Supernatural lightning is often used by divine beings. Lightning is particularly effective against mortals and constructs. It can cause dangerous conditions like "paralysed", "immobilised", "incapacitated" and "stunned". Flammable materials react to lightning damage in the same way as they react to heat damage.

**Light** damage can be caused by intense light, which can ablate both surface and deep layers of an entity. Natural light is often effective against monsters and undead. Supernatural light is particularly effective against spiritual and profane beings. It tends to cause "frightened", "blinded", "catatonic" and "incapacitated".

___
#### Esoteric damage 

Esoteric damage is caused by, typically powerful, supernatural beings. It typically affects either the spirit or essence of an entity. Esoteric damage cannot exist in a world without the "supernatural". These three damage types are particularly dangerous because they ignore the SP and MP of entities that are not divine.

**Divine** damage directly eliminates a target's spiritual essence. Targets without spirit (mainly objects) are not affected by this damage type. Profane beings and mortals are particularly vulnerable to it. Divine damage typically causes "unconscious", "catatonic", "immobilised", "incapacitated", "aphonia", "blinded" or "frightened". Beware the wrath of the gods. **NB**: Divine damage is caused only by high level abilities and powerful entities. Healing spells also cause divine damage, but only to undead.

**Entropic** damage prevents the laws of creation from functioning, causing physical targets to disintegrate or mutate horribly, while spiritual targets are rendered down to pure chaos. Typically this damage type causes "crippled", "incapacitated" or "bleeding". **NB**: Divine damage is caused only by high level abilities and powerful entities.

**Profane** damage is caused **exclusively** by profane entities. It is the destruction of goodness and vital energies, as well as the draining of spiritual energy. Constructs and undead are the only entities that are safe from this damage type. It typically causes "dying", "paralysed", "immobilised", "restrained", "aphonia", "frightened" and "charmed".

___
#### Damage rankings

Not all damage types were created equal. This is intentional. easily "obtained" damage types have more counter measures than "rare", "dangerous" or "expensive" damage types. In return the lower class damage types are more easily available, cheaper, and generally have a greater "magnitude".

- Divine (S Class)
- Entropic (S Class)
- Profane (S Class)
- Corrosive (A Class)
- Electricity (A Class) 
- Light (A Class)
- Cold (B Class)
- Heat (B Class)
- Necrotic (B Class)
- Poison (B Class)
- Pressure (B Class)
- Bludgeoning (C Class)
- Piercing (C Class)
- Shear (C Class)
- Slashing (C Class)

___
### Entity types

- Everything is either "**natural**" (that is to say it obeys the physical laws of the world and can be explained by them), or **supernatural** (that is to say that it does not and cannot).
- All entities are either:
  1. **Mortals**.
  2. **Machines**.
  3. **Divine**/**Profane**/**Spiritual** entities.
- Most entities are mortals, including characters. All mortals are alive and can die.
- Machines are not alive and therefore cannot die. They can however be created and destroyed.
- Divine/Profane/Spiritual entities are often not truly alive, and often tend to be eternal. Some are referred to as "gods" or "immortals". This leaves some unanswered questions as to what the rest of them are. Whatever else, they are all **supernatural**.
- In addition creatures fall into other categories that have additional properties and rules pertaining to them.
- There are more types of "supernatural" entity, but most entities a character is likely to encounter are probably "natural".
- Entity types include:
  - **Mortals**
    - **animal** (Nat)
    - **humanoid** (Nat or Sup)
    - **monster** (Nat or Sup)
    - **plant** (Nat or Sup)

  - **Profane**
    - **fiend** (Sup)
    - **undead** (Sup)

### Detailed Entity descriptions

#### Mortals

Mortals are the most common entities in the material world. Mortals have a physical form, limited lifespan and age by necessity. They need to breathe, drink, eat.

**Plants** are the the most common mortals. Plants are generally stationary (no movement speed) and generate organic mass by using water and minerals from the earth they grow in, and energy from sunlight. Some plants, however prey on other creatures.
- Plants do not sleep.
- Immunities: "frightened", "blinded", "stunned", "catatonic" and "paralysed".

**Animals** are mobile mortals with an Int below 5. They consume other mortals to live.
- Animals need to sleep.

**Humanoids** are bipedal animals with an Int of 5 and above.
- Humanoids need to sleep.

**Dragons** look like reptiles but are not. These are supernatural entities with 6 or more limbs (of which 2 or more typically wings) and scales. They have an Int of at least 10. Dragons typically have obscenely long lifespans and possess the following characteristic features:
- A dragon's eye can see through illusions.
- Dragons have an "elemental" organ, which allows them to exhale energy, typically fire.
- Dragons need sleep.
- Dragons are an apex lifeform and as such are immune to fear.
- Dragons are immune to one element.
- Dragons are resistant to "slashing", "shear" and "bludgeoning" damage.

**Monsters** are mortals that do not fit in other categories. Some resemble animals, but are far more intelligent. Some resemble humanoids, but are not. Many are supernatural. They have no unifying trait, but tend to be dangerous to humanoids.

___
#### Constructs

Constructs are life-like devices that are capable of movement and are generally made of minerals or metals. They are sometimes called "living dolls", although this term is not strictly correct. Constructs do not reproduce, breathe, drink, eat, sleep or age (unless they are made from mortals).

**Robots** are "natural" constructs, typically made by mortals. In the worlds where they exist, they are the height of non-magical artifice. Since they are merely complex machines, robots lack a spirit and thus have no Cha. Robots that are capable of emulating emotion use Int for Cha rolls. A robot that gains a spirit becomes a golem.
- Robots are immune to: "Frightened", "charmed", "surprise", "diseased", "poisoned", "bleeding", "incapacitated" and "dying".
- Robots are resistant to "physical" damage.

**Golems** are "supernatural" constructs. Typically they are created for tasks which mortals cannot accomplish because of frailness or limited lifespan. Golems typically continue to carry out these tasks long after their creators pass on.
- Golems are immune to: "Frightened", "charmed", "surprise", "diseased", "poisoned", "bleeding", "stunned" "incapacitated", "catatonic" and "dying".
- Golems are at least resistant to "physical" damage and all "energy"[Nat] damage.

___
#### Spiritual

Spiritual entities are those for which the spirit is the main form and the physical form is a decoration rather than a necessity. Spiritual entities do not sleep or age, although they may need to breathe, drink and eat.
- Spiritual entities are immune to "physical" damage, as their physical form is either unnecessary or not "real".
- Spiritual beings are immune to "stunned", "immobilised", "crippled", "bleeding", "poisoned", and "paralysed".

**Elementals** are spirits of metaphysical elements of "air", "water", "fire", "earth" (although others might exist). Elementals attract the material of their element to them, giving the appearance of a physical form. However, the elemental does not require this  "body", and attacking it does not damage the elemental. In many worlds they are thought to be part of the mechanisms of creation. Elementals do not breathe, drink or eat.
- An elemental in its element regenerates a number of MP and SP dice equal to at least its "base" (and often more).
- An elemental is immune to "restrained", "surprised", "helpless" and "dying" in its element.

**Fey** are spirits paradoxically associated with the natural world. Most move between the material world and whatever immaterial realms may be adjacent to it.
- Fey are immune to "charm", "aphonia" and "deafened".
- All fey have at least one ability that causes "frightened" or "charmed".
- Most fey have a "blink" speed.

**Spirits** are spiritual beings that do not fall into either of the above categories. A mortal's soul is said to become a spirit when it loses its body.

___
#### Divine

Divine entities are those that are involved in some way in the creation of maintenance of creation, or are a manifestation of a law, concept or process of creation. Divine entities are typically incredibly powerful by the standards of mortals, and some are worshipped as gods. Divine entities do not need to breath, drink, eat, or sleep, but are often capable of doing so. They do not age.
- Divine entities are immune to all "natural" damage and resistant to "divine" damage.
- They are immune to "surprised", "charmed", "frightened", "stunned" and "dying".

**Angels** are the creations of gods, or manifestations of creation itself. They are generally created as messengers and observers, but also occasionally enforcing the will of their creator. Not all angels have free will (Cha). Not all angels align with the typical human understanding of "good" (especially the messengers of dark gods).
- All angels have true sight, can discern truth from lie.
- Angels takes 1HP damage whenever they lie. Some are incapable of lying.
- Angels are immune to "light" damage and vulnerable to "profane" damage.
- Angels have advantage on attacks against "Profanes".

**Glitches** or aberrations, are flaws or inconsistencies in creation made manifest.
- Glitches are immune to "divine" damage and resistant to "profane" damage.
- Glitches heal 1HP when they are hit with an attack or ability that deals "divine" damage.
- Glitches have at least one ability that causes "entropic" damage.
- Glitches generally take on a form which is biologically, and often physically impossible.

Other **divines** are often gods or manifestations of creation. Divines can only be destroyed by "entropic" damage. A divine that reaches minus its HP total from any other type of damage dissipates and reforms somewhere else at another time (possible "here" and "now" if it happens to be sufficiently powerful).
- All divines have true sight, can discern truth from lie.
- Divines are immune to "divine" damage and vulnerable to "entropic" damage.
- Divines are immune to "prone", "stunned", "blinded", "deafened" and "aphonic".

___
#### Profane

Profane beings are those that have been cursed by creation and whose nature drives them to destroy or oppose it. Profane beings do not breath, sleep or age, although some eat and drink.
- Profane entities have vulnerability to "divine" damage and immunity to "disease" and "poison".
- Profane entities have resistance to "physical" damage.
- They also have immunity to "unconscious" and "dying".

**Fiends** are entities opposed to creation or mortal-kind. In realms where they exist, devils and demons are fiends. Sometimes divine entities fall and become fiends. Fiends that do not reach minus their total HP from "divine" damage will be reborn elsewhere, at another time (hence cycles of dark lord and heroes).
- Fiends are resistant to energy.

**Undead** are the bodies or souls of deceased mortals that refuse to rest.
- Undead are immune to "stunned", "charmed", "frightened" and "paralysed".

## Conditions and states
Entities can be affected by a number of conditions, most of them bad. For now these include (and all are badly defined!). Conditions are classified in S to C class based on how much trouble an entity is in if it is afflicted by it. This starts from deadly peril (S) to mildly inconvenient (C). Of course classification is not always absolute.

- "**Doomed**": S++ Class
- "**Dying**": S Class
- "**Helpless**": S Class
- "**Paralysed**": S Class
- "**Unconscious**": S Class
- "**Catatonic**": A Class
- "**Crippled**": A Class
- "**Immobilised**": A Class
- "**Incapacitated**": A Class
- "**Stunned**": A Class
- "**Bleeding/Wilting**": B Class
- "**Blinded**": B Class
- "**Charmed**": B Class
- "**Restrained**": B Class
- "**Surprised**": B Class
- "**Frightened**": B Class
- "**Aphonia**": B/C Class
- "**Deafened**": C Class
- "**Glowing**": C Class
- "**Grappled**": C Class
- "**Inaudible**": C Class
- "**Invisible**": C Class
- "**Prone**": C Class
- "**Diseased**": S-C Class
- "**Poisoned**": S-C Class

An entity afflicted by conditions that make it unable to engage in physical combat or other activities is considered **"disabled"**. This is a useful catch all. These conditions are: "dying", "helpless", "paralysed", "unconscious", "catatonic", "immobilised", "stunned" or "surprised".
