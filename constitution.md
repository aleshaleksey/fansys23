# System 2023 Constitution

This document describes RAI, and sets out base rules and principles behind the system. Any rule in the system that does not conform to this constitution needs to be modified to make sure that it does (potentially more than one will need to be modified).

## Points
1. The system is designed for fantasy roleplaying.
2. The system focuses on balance and flexibility.
3. The system uses the sum of a dice roll and static bonus as the core roll.
4. The core roll should ensure that both the bonus and the roll have a statistically meaningful effect on the outcome in most cases.
5. The system should roughly balance all attributes and abilities using the following principles:
    - If an ability designed to diversify builds is almost always needed for a general kind of build, it is too strong or too broad.
    - If an ability designed to diversify builds is almost never a a good choice, it is too weak or too specific.
    - If an attribute/skill needs to be present/high in almost all builds, it is too strong/broad and needs to narrowed/weakened.
    - If an attribute/skill is almost never used, it is too weak/narrow.
6. Damage types are balanced by the principles of cost and evolution.
    - If a damage type is very common, enemies will develop resistance to it. So if a damage type is common and enemies do not have resistance to it, this should be changed.
    - If a damage type is so fundamentally effective that resistance cannot be developed, everyone would want to use it and it would become the only damage type, unless it was very dangerous to the user or had a high cost that prevented its use. If a super-effective damage type exists and it is not expensive or dangerous, this needs to be changed.
7. Every ability and strategy, even one that looks like it has no way to counter it, must have a counter. If it does not, a mechanism to allow one must be developed, or the ability or abilities at the foundation of the strategy must be developed.
8. "1/100 hit points? Fully Functional!" is not a tenable position. Injury should result in some deterioration for verisimilitude.
9. No ability path should replicate the mechanics of another with no changes other than governing ability or fluff. If this happens the duplicate must be removed. Even "auto-hit" abilities should have a counter or two.
    - Skills can partially overlap (that is natural), but the overlap must be limited.
    - Spells should not mirror what martial abilities should be.
    - Weapons should be made mechanistically unique, or when it is not possible represented by a single weapon stat (eg. gladius/shortsword/smallsword).
10. Martial and Casting type characters should both be viable at all levels when not deliberately build to be ineffective.
11. All the abilities and mechanics put into the game should be useable. If the mechanic is not useable, then it should either be removed or changed to be useable.
    - Non-humanoid characters should be viable (at least mid-level and up).
    - Flight and exotic movement types should be viable.
    - Combat manoeuvres should not be a waste of space.
12. For damage over time from whatever source, the save and damage should be resolved at the start of a turn. This is especially important for area auras.
13. Damage that bypasses "soft shielding", instantly kills, or is somehow clearly superior in some way, should not be available to player characters at low levels. When it is available, it should be expensive so that it is at least somewhat situational.
