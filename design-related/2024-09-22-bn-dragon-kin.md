RACE RULES
Colours: Black, White, Red, Green, Blue
	-Children can inherit colour mixes
	-These colours are 'First Ones'
	-Offshoots (i.e purple) inherit half of the benefits of the original 5 colours.

	-For players being able to use their favourite colours, DM can assign these bonuses to whatever colour 	they prefer. But these reassignments must affect all other dragonborn in game

	Base Colour Bonuses & Penalties as per template rules:
	Black +2 CON, -2 WIS (Hardy warrior type)
	White +2 INT, -2 CON (Debators, brain more active than body)
	Red +2 CHA, -2 STR (Bards/Sorcerer types, Prefer talk than fighting)
	Green +2 STR, -2 DEX (Larger side champions, sluggish due to muscle mass)
	Blue +2 WIS, -2 INT (Sage dragons, perfect recall)
	
	-Suggestion to allow players to pick their own bonuses+penalties to suit a build, but for standard (NPC) 	characters to follow these base rules

	-All racial members have vestigial wings, mounted below shoulder blades. At level 5, characters gain 10ft fly speed.
		>Rises by 10ft per level until 40ft.
		>Each level after 40ft cap confers better rating on flying
	-Characters with parents of the same colour gain shining and lustrous scales and a bonus to be decided on later

TEMPLATE POINTS (8pts):
	-Keen Smell (1pt)
	
	-Skill +1. Based on colour (1pt):
		Black = Consitution based skill (unknown at present)
		White = Academics
		Red = Persuade
		Blue = Observe
		Green = Athletics
	Ofshoots gain bonuses of both original colours but gain -2 to a skill not derived as a bonus. 
		So for a Pink (Red/White) character, +1 INT skill, +1 CHA skill, -2 to a STR/CON/DEX/WIS skill of choice
	
	-Tool proficiency (1pt)
		Based on colour type, character gains a tool proficiency from their highest attribute (Player must pick one only on equal highest attributes)

	-Colours confer resistance B/C to a damage type, ADV vs class C condition (2pts):
		Black = Physical affecting spells (i.e Polymorph)
		White = Mental affecting spells (i.e Mind blank)
		Red = Heat damage (i.e fireball, fireplace)
		Blue = Electricity damage (i.e lightning bolt, a large static discharge)
		Green = Poison damage  (i.e spray poison, bad food)
	-Resistance to mixed types is impossible. A black and white (so grey) character would mutate this resistance in to Magical 	resistance, but vulnerability to fire for instance. DMs choice or roll damage vulnerability. "First Ones" do not suffer vulnerability

	-Race has a universal gland that secretes a conductive gel. Atomised and sprayed as breath using the same organ.
		Race colour determines what is conducted. Fire, lighting, poison etc

### Dragonkin (level-1 template = 8 points)
Also known in various worlds as "Dragonborn", "Dragonblood" and by any other number of pretentious names. Dragonkin are humanoids with some similarities to true dragons. Sometimes, as they age and gain power, they may become true dragons. Notably they tend to have vestigial wings, reptilian tails, and the ability to breath fire, or a different element. In worlds where dragons are color coded for convenience, the same applies to dragonkin.
