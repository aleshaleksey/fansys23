## Rules for making spells

Rules for making spells are an oxymoron, since magic is often seen as being above rules and logic. However, for the sake of balancing a game, some rules that determine how spells are made and work are required.

More powerful spells have a higher MP dice cost, weaker spells have a lower MP dice cost. Spell power and utility can also be tweaked by adjusting the cost and availability of materials and foci, as well as changing the duration of casting. To be systematic in this development, there should be clear rules on how to calculate the cost, duration, components etc. of a spell. On the other hand, this is unlikely to be an exact science, since the power of a spell is determined to a large degree by circumstances and player creativity. Thus any such system should be well thought out and flexible. Ultimately the cost of a spell should correlate perfectly with its agency. Where:

Agency = [probability that the spell is useful in a situation] x [how strongly it affects outcome]

### Power consideration of Local spells
- Damage: Class (C-S), number of damage types, amount of damage.
- Conditions: Class(C-S), number of conditions.
- Movement Modalities.
- Bonuses.
- Healing.
- Duration.
- Casting time.
- Concentration.
- Range.
- Number of targets.
- Material and foci.
- Which components and number of components.

#### Base spell, local:
- Spell points: 4
- Max "traits": 3 + 4 x MP
- Damage: None 
- Condition: None
- Movement Modalities: None
- Bonuses: None
- Healing: None
- Duration: ~1 round.
- Casting time: Main action.
- Concentration: None
- Range: Close IF incantation. 30ft IF kinetic.
- Targets: 1 OR 1 square.
- Material and foci: None
- Components: Kinetic

## Cost rules

When creating spells the cost rules should be guided by the principle of agency and balance (see agency equation). However these are almost impossible to to formalise mathematically while keeping the formula useable. As such the numbers presented here are an easily abusable guide.

Any spell created using this guide MUST be checked and validated. In general no spell of a lower level should be more useful or more potent than a higher level spell that is uses the same magic type or is useable in the same circumstances as a primary purpose.

- Spell points: +(1 + MP dice total) per MP dice. (MP1=2, MP2=2+3=5, MP3=2+3+4=9, etc)
- Damage magnitude: +3 per (C class, 1d12) OR (B class, 1d8) OR (A class, 1d6) OR +12 (S class 1d6) 
- Condition: +2 if Class C, +4 if Class B, +6 if Class A, +12 if Class S.
- Healing: +5 per HP. +3 per condition MIN=LVL1
- Modality: +3 if C(walk, climb, swim), +6 if B(flyA, dig), +9 if Fly(G), +12 if (blink), +15 if S(cosmic). Water-walk=6?

- Duration (damage): +6 if min, +12 if 12 min.
- Duration (healing): +2 per round/HP.
- Duration Special: Some mundane effects may be permanent. This pertains mainly to diseases.
- Casting time (no damage ): Secondary (+2), Main(0), Full round(-2).
- Casting time (damage or conditions): Secondary(+2), Main(0), Full round(-1), 1 minute (-2).
- Casting time: Reaction + 4.
- Concentration: All damage spells with a non-instantaneous duration MUST be concentration. Otherwise -3 if concentration
- Range: +1 per range up (15, 30, 60, 120, 240), -1 per range down. (+1 per 60ft increment)
- Range (harmless): The realm: +15. All realms +30.
- Targets +2 per target or +2 per 5ft radius. SPECIAL: Only +1 for the first *N* increases for a spell of cost *N* MP.
- Material: -2 if material, -1 if focus. -1 if either is rare.
- Components: Incantation only (+1), Kinetic only (0), Kinetic + Incantation (-1)
- Half on save: All spells whose primary effect is damage and cost MP have a half on save rule. Those that don't have a -6 to cost.

#### Examine "Wind Walk"
|Name|Wind Walk [Air, Nature, Travel]|
|-|-|
|Scope|Local (Global)|
|MP|3 (12)|
|Target(s)|1 or more entities|
|Casting time|"main action" (1h + 20 min per 4MP dice)|
|Range|close|
|Duration|12 min+ (1 day+)|+6
|Components|incantation|+1(7)
|Materials|None (12 dandelion heads)|-2(5)
|Limitation|target cannot be earth aligned|-2(3)
|Save|Wis (harmless), no effect|

**Description**: The target gains a good fly speed equal to your walking speed + 20ft, as if walking upon the air. When the spell ends, the target loses this movement modality immediately.

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice (4, if casting globally) placed in the spell you can add either: 1. An extra target, 2. an extra 6 minutes of effect.

**Global**: The spell has a duration of 1 day + 6h per extra 4MP or gives flight to an additional target.

- Spell points: 
- Damage types: NONE
- Damage magnitude: NONE
- Condition: NONE
- Healing: NONE
- Modality: Fly(G) (+9)
- Duration (no damage): 12 min (+6)
- Casting time (no damage or conditions): Main (0)
- Concentration: NONE
- Range: Incantation-close (0)
- Targets: 1 (0)
- Material: None
- Components: Incantation only (+1)
- Total SP points: +9+3+1=13
- Therefore cost: (13-4)/3=C=3
