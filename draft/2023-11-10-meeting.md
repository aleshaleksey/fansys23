**Date:** 2023-11-10
**Here:** Alek, Alluscythe, Niall.
**Writeup:** Alek
**Agenda:**
- Assess how much time we can give.
- See if our aims for a game system are close enough to make working together worth our while.
 - Play feel: What system should it feel like? What should it be like to play? What kind of genre should it support?
 - Rules Weight: How rules heavy should it be?
 - Rules clarity: How strictly codified should it be?
 - Dice kind: What kind of dice should it use?
 - Mechanistic scope: What game activities should be codified in the rules and how?
 - Attributes: What attributes to use? (And how to use them)
 - Skills: What skills to support?
 - Magic: Scope, format, role in the system.
 - Classes: How rigid/flexible? Do we use them at all?

__Play Feel__
- Alek: Fantasy. A bit like 5e, character creation depth of DnD3.5. Nice clear rules.
- Niall: Yes. More choice and variety in character creation. More personalisation and ownership. More PFish.
- Allu: "I agree." More depth of weaponary. Better support for martial characters. Research skill should be a thing. (See Witcher).

__Mechanistic Scope__
- Alek: Combat (low level of abstraction). Exploration, social, crafting, maybe strategy (high level of abstraction).
- Niall: Yes, mass combat could also be interesting. Research rules (see witcher).
- Allu: Yes. Also formal rules for learning skills.

__Rules weight and clarity__
- ALL: About as heavy as 5e, but properly codified.
- Alek: Limited number of abilities, traits, etc, with high potential for combining them to give rise to complexity.

__Dice System__
- Alek: D20 or2D12. (Other systems were mentioned, but discarded as too different from D20 systems).
- D20 is favoured. 2D12 can be explored.
- Whatever it is it should be fun and not bog down.

__Attributes__
- Generally agreed that 4 is too few. 8 might be nice, or not.
- Stick to 6 for now and change if it is not satisfactory.

__Fuel Source for Abilities__
- Allu: Blood magic as an example of using HP.
- Niall: Seconded.
- Alek: Stamina could be used for martial abilities. To distinguish.

__Scope of Magic vs martial__
- Alek: Magic should not overshadow martial or skill. Martial abilities should be stronger than magic in combat. Skills should be able to achieve wonderful things. Magic should be able to achieve things that are impossible by normal means (normally impossible transportation, transformation, miraculous healing, seeing the unseable, countering supernatural threats).
- Niall: Yes. Also Tangent.
- Allu: Martials should have their own "magic" (eg Steel Wind Strike as a "martial" spell vs Lightning Bolt as a spellcaster "spell").
- Allu clarified with Niall: Martials and Mages should be able to use their abilities to achieve the same goals, but with different "price" and "side-effects".

__Niall Sidetrack__
- Combat should feel like combat. Single monsters should be able to give a party a good fight. It should be able to go back and forth.

__Spell forumaltion:__
- All: It should be clear and concise and immediately clear.
- Allu: Mechanics should be listed above fluff, so you can read it instantly.
- Niall: Like Dnd-3.5: A spell should be able to give you an elevator pitch.

__Global magic__
- Alek: Like in Age of Wonders, I want global magic that has a high price, long casting time and changes the world, allowing to explain things like "This city has had a magic barrier since...".
- Allu: Gives a nice example from a character where it worked well.
- Niall: I remember Age of Wonders.
- All: This is cool, but we need a working mechanism.

__Skills__
- Alek: Would like Pathfinder style skills. But let's pretend to consider other systems.
- Allu: Vampire has a nice system.
- Alek: 0,..,0
- Niall: Proper social skills would be nice.
- Some debate on what a social skill is and how it should be used.

__Addendum__
- Rules should come with guidelines of how they should be applied and why there are there.
- We should support exotic races and flight in a sensible, balanced manner.
- Opinions and creative disagreements should be solved by thorough testing to find better solution.
- Skills should have flexible attribute use (depending on circumstances, method of use and desired result).
- Aim for simple foundation, with combinations giving rise to complexity, instead of complex fundamentals.

__Initial Tasks__
- Niall: Tabulate skills, what they should achieve, how they should interact with attributes (so think about attributes too).
- Allu: Tabulate weapons, training, use, durability and whatever else you think is necessary.
- Alek: Attrition models with various combinations of HP (hard "health")and "Stamina".
