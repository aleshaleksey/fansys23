__Damage types and sources (Proposal).__
There are four points here. Points 1-3 are the basis of a system. Point 4 is stating the obvious.

1. Split damage into Natural and Supernatural by source.
 - eg. A necromancer's touch would be Necrotic[supernatural] and go against MP.
 - eg. A wizard's fireball, or a devil's hellfire would be heat[supernatural] and go against MP.
 - eg. A bear's claw would be slashing[natural] and go against SP.
 - eg. A house fire would be heat[natural] and go against SP.
 
2. Split damage into discrete categories by type.
 - eg. Both a bonfire, and a devil's hellfire would be "heat" or "fire".

3. Most types of damage can be of either source ([natural] or [supernatural]) but some damage types can only be natural or supernatural.
 - eg. Fire (heat) can be natural or supernatural (eg. bonfire vs hellfire).
 - eg. Lightning can be natural or supernatural (eg. bad weather vs angry wizrd).
 - eg. Slashing can only be natural. A "supernatural" sword would deal a different damage type.
 - eg. "Holy"/"Divine" (by definition divine), or "necrotic" (attacking lifeforce, a concept which is distinctly esoteric) should probably only ever be supernatural. So a "Holy Sword" would deal holy[supernatural] damage.
 
4. Damage types should be balanced (no 5e "force damage cantrips for all, lol"). All of the principles here can be derived from looking at evolution, arms races and common sense.
 - A damage type that is common and easily accessible should have more things that are resistant to it.
 - A damage type that is easily accessible but not common should be dangerous to the user or have undesired side-effects (or it would be common!).
 - A damage type that is not easily accessible is also not be common by definition, and should have fewer things that are resistant to. Perhaps abilities that cause this kind of damage are higher level or have a higher cost, or there are fewer creatures that cause them (eg, Hellfire (heat[supernatural]) is rare because there are not many devils in the material realm. Because of this few creatures have resistance, and countermeasures are not common.).
 
5. We need not use exactly the same types as DnD 5e or Pathfinder (in fact for copyright reasons we had better not). Partially because they had some redundant [read: stupid] damage types.
 - eg. "thunder" (damage due to a pressure wave) and "force" (all physical damage is force, so this is just "physical damage) should either be merged into "percussive"/"explosive", or eschewed entirely as in both cases, in terms of the physics, this is very similar to percussive damage.
 - eg. There is no clear damage type for cosmic rays, lasers, radiation and the like in DnD/pathfinder (people argue radiant, necrotic, fire, lightning, force and everything in between), so we can add it (even if we seldom get to use it).

6. Damage types should have a short list of possible associated conditions. Associated conditions should not necessarily be unique per damage type, but should follow common sense, game balance and verisimilitude (where reasonably possible). This will make a lot of downstream work simpler and avoid a lot of "specific" rules.

__Advantages:__
- This allows easy symmetry between SP and MP, and eliminates most of the arguments about what damage should go against which one.
- Gives an extra layer of tactical complexity without fagging things up too much.
- Avoids the PF/DnD problem of "after level 4 everyone's dealing magic/force damage. DR in all its forms is now pointless."

__Disadvantage__
- Different from DnD and PF, so people need to get used to it.
- An extra layer of complexity over DnD5e (but not PF). I don't think this is bad, but it can be.

__Damage types in Ryuutama__
None. Fooled you.

__Suggested damage types__
I would like to "type" damage by the way in which destruction is caused.
- Physical: (Can only be [natural])
 - Slashing.
 - Piercing.
 - Percussive.
 - Explosive (pressure).

- Energy: (Can be [natural] or [supernatural])
 - Heat. (Fire) eg. bonfire[natural], laser[natural], fireball[supernatural], hellfire[supernatural].
 - Cold. (Ice) eg. exposure[natural], frost-drake-breath[supernatural].
 - Electricity. (Lightning) eg. lightning[natural], electric eel[natural], lightning spell[supernatural].
 - "light"/"Energy". eg: Cosmic-rays[natural].
 
- Corrosive. (Acid/Base/Solvent) (can be [natural] or [supernatural]).
- Poison. (Biological) (can be [natural] or [supernatural]).

- Esoteric: (Can only be [supernatural]: It is not a concept that can exist in a world without magic)
 - Divine. (Elimination of spiritual essense by divine mechanisms)
 - Entropic. (Destruction of the order that gives rise to structure/life)
 - Necrotic/thanotic. (Destruction of "life force"/"essense").
 
**Removed Damage types**
- NB: "Force" damage is removed because it doesn't explain anything!
