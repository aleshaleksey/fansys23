This chapter discusses resources, basic fantasy economy and item/equipment prices. Most "adventurers" need equipment, weapons and supplies in some shape and form, so they are covered here.

## Economy and economies

We assume that the settings that will be used with this system might range from classical/ancient to early medieval, to renaissance to industrial revolution, and might not be based on european civilisations. The availability of natural resources, knowledge/crafting techniques and "human" resources (labour) will naturally vary, which will affect item prices and availability. This will also be affected by how high or low magic the setting is. With this in mind three lists are presented: "ancient", "medieval" and "late".

Of course if a group has its own setting, then why not have your own list?

___
### Ancient Setting

In this kind of setting some sorts of knowledge may well be very well developed (Rome, Egypt, China are good examples of this), but population densities are generally are quite low, working of iron is limited and poorly developed. On the other hand slavery is generally widespread, so labour costs can be minimal for manual labour. Weapons and armour are somewhat "simple" although arguably this is more related to suitability rather than lack of ability to make something more complex. The world is not mapped, and much of it is ruled by monsters, spirits and other strange forces. Gods and demons might walk the world. At the same time there might be few ruins of previous civilisations.

___
### Early Medieval and Dark ages

This is a classical dark adventuring setting. Many fields of knowledge, sciences for example, are lost. There many ruins of fallen empire. The population density is low. Possibly much of the population is bound in serfdom, keeping labour costs low. On the hand iron-work develops to a higher level, so heavy armour and weapons designed to overcome it begin to develop. Much of the world is not mapped and there are many ruins of civilisations that have been lost to time. Monsters and spirits are still rampant.

___
### Late, renaissance and industrial age

This is the usual "adventuring guilds" settings. All kinds of weapons and armours are available. Some have become obsolete (under some situations). Firearms become available. Techniques of extracting resources and crafting become very efficient, and all kinds of sciences flourish. Labour costs are high, but productivity of labour also increases due to advanced techniques and industrialisation. Population densities are generally high. Most of the world has been at least crudely mapped. Most ruins have been found and at least some are explored. It is possible that monsters and other "inhuman" forces have retreated (but who knows?).

___
### Currency

The most common currency was generally silver, although gold, copper, bronze, electrum (gold/silver allow) and other currencies have been used. The main prerequisite was that the material can be worked with available tools, does not degrade much over time and is scarce. Gold generally was worth 10-20 times more than silver. Copper currency was used mostly locally. However, silver coin or trade bars of various sizes were the most common. Good examples include the English "silver penny" (1.4g-1.55g) and the Athenian silver drachma (~4.3g).

This also brings up the phantom of different currencies between kingdoms. If a group is playing a socially complex game, it may be worth introducing different convertible currency or tender between powers. A roughly ~5% conversion fee seems to be a fair average to use as a starting point.

By default, this game uses an anachronistic mix of modern pound (lb) measurement together with a silver obol (1/6th of a drachma), weighing ~0.76g to give us 600 silver pieces (sp) per lb (actual Obols had a weight closer to ~0.72g). The choice is made to have a practical minimum unit. Although of course most sane kingdoms would have larger denominations. I would recommend a modified drachma (~4.5g, 100/lb) and dekadrachma (~45g, 10/lb). These values are used for ease of calculation and not any semblance of pseudo-historical accuracy.

|Currency|Weight(lb)|Conversion from obols|Weight (g)|
|-|-|-|-|
|Obol|1/600|1|0.76|
|Drachma|1/100|x10|4.5|
|Dekadrachma|1/10|x100|45|
|Silver penny|1/300[1]|x2|1.5|

1. Remember, we're using modern lb and a "modified" penny and not the measure with 240d/lb.

More importantly, the lists will give a cost in "days of labour", which are equivalent to 12 manhours. Often, in a world where everything is made by hand and not always stockpiled, the labour availability is more important than the material or currency cost.

___
### Labour costs and crafting times

Crafting costs are a sum of the labour cost and the material costs. Labour costs depend on the level of the worker, and the number of man hours that they need to work to complete the task.

___
### Materials

Materials come in a hierarchy of hardness/quality. Materials higher on the scale have superior qualities, are harder to work with, generally rarer, give bonuses to attack/damage/armour/durability, etc. Materials lower on the scale are usually cheaper and easier to work with, but also make for less effective tools, weapons and armour.

___
## The lists

The lists a monetary cost, a labour cost and an availability table. The availability should be taken with a large pinch of salt and is meant as a guide for settings. If availability is "no" the weapon is not generally available or the technology or technique to make it does not exist. "Rare" means it was available at some point of the age, but were not commonly used.

If availability is "no" the item cannot be made, but may be bought from specialist suppliers at x10 the price.

If availability is "rare", the item cost is x2 and the crafting time is x2.

If the time is "ancient" crafting times for mostly metal items is x2 the base time. If the time is "late" the crafting cost is 1/2 the base time.

Importantly crafting time can be shared between several artisans.

### Labour Costs

Labour costs are given in silver (sp) per day (10-12 hours). Labour that does not need to be paid for, still has to be fed. Generally it should be assumed that the wages of unskilled workers, trained worker, mercenaries and scribes includes food and board where appropriate. The wages are given for medium sized humanoids. Larger entities, like giants, will have a significantly higher upkeep, but will also accomplish certain tasks, especially construction and mining a lot more quickly and effectively.

|Labour type|ancient |medieval |late |
|-|-|-|-|
|Unskilled|0|1|2|
|Trained|0|2|~5|
|Artisan (mason)|0-4|~8|~20|
|Artisan (smith)|0-4|~16|~40|
|mercenary (foot)||~6|~15|
|mercenary (specialist)||~24|~50|
|mercenary (captain)||~200|~500|
|scribe/priest||~6|~15|
|magistrate||~500||

___
### Resources

This table provides some numbers for how much of a resource one can expect to harvest from an area. An acre is 121 x 360 feet or about 24 x 72 5ft squares.

|Item|Yield ancient|Yield medieval|Yield late
|-|-|-|-|
|Wheat|320lb|320lb|800lb|
|Apple|4000lb|4000lb|8000lb|
|Lumber||||
|Iron||||
|Marble||||

**Wheat**: Yield is per acre. Usually 1g of seeds was sown for 12-100g of harvest. Lower yield in earlier ages were associated with higher yields of straw which is also an important material. You need about half a dozen peasants for 10 acres.

*Acre of land*: Land in many kingdoms is not commonly available and cannot be bought and sold without special permission from officials, lords or kings.

*Keep*: A stone keep measures approximately 48 x 48 x 48 feet, has 3-4 stories and walls about 4-6 feet thick. The crafting days can be split between any number of workers and include procurement and transport costs. Even if additional man power is available, medium sized humanoids will not accomplish this task in less than 3 months by conventional means.

**Entrenching tools**: This is a full set of equipment needed to fortify a a field position or make a simple dwelling. It includes, hammer, chisel, axe, shovel, knives and a number of other implements.

**Farmer's Equipment**: Farmer's equipment consists of yokes, ploughs, shovels and other minimal equipment needed to raise crops. Animals not included.

**Smith's tools**: A minimal set of tools needed to make use of a forge or make a field forge. Using a field forge gives -5 on all crafting rolls. The set include hammers, vice, chisels, small anvil and other implements. The set weighs about 30lb.

**Smith's forge**: A complete forge. This is not mobile and consists of furnace as well as all other tools and structures for turning an iron ingot into an implement.

**Musical instruments (simple)**: This mostly includes simple wind instruments made of reed, with no metal parts and no rare materials. These would be welcome at a festival, a fey glade, ora village tavern, but might get you laughed out of town or executed at a king's court.

**Musical instruments (average)**: This includes more robust wind instruments and certain percussion, such as tambourines. Certain simpler string instruments would fall in this category. They might contain mixture of wooden, hide and metal parts and would be acceptable either as a performance in a town's tavern or as part of a band or orchestra. A buffoon at a court might use instruments from this category.

**Musical instrument (complex)**: This includes most string instruments (guitars/lutes, violins, harps, lyres), as brass and certain others. These would be acceptable at many mortal courts and would draw crowds at backwater settlements for their rarity.

**Musical instrument (exquisite)**: This includes things like pianos, church organs and other large, complex instruments. They are generally nor easily transported.

# Notes

1. Currency is quite interesting and worth reading up on. For simplicity I am sticking with silver.
2. Tracking down historical prices is quite laborious and difficult. It is actually questionable whether historical prices should be relied on at all in a game. Especially since game balance by equipment cost is probably more important for us than historical accuracy.
3. Interestingly the costs do not vary as much as one would expect from DnD and PF list prices
