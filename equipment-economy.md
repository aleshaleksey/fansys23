# Equipment and Economy

This chapter discusses resources, basic fantasy economy and item/equipment prices. Most "adventurers" need equipment, weapons and supplies in some shape and form, so they are covered here.

## Economy and economies

We assume that the settings that will be used with this system might range from classical/ancient to early medieval, to renaissance to industrial revolution, and might not be based on european civilisations. The availability of natural resources, knowledge/crafting techniques and "human" resources (labour) will naturally vary, which will affect item prices and availability. This will also be affected by how high or low magic the setting is. With this in mind three lists are presented: "ancient", "medieval" and "late".

Of course if a group has its own setting, then why not have your own list?

### Ancient Setting

In this kind of setting some sorts of knowledge may well be very well developed (Rome, Egypt, China are good examples of this), but population densities are generally are quite low, working of iron is limited and poorly developed. On the other hand slavery is generally widespread, so labour costs can be minimal for manual labour. Weapons and armour are somewhat "simple" although arguably this is more related to suitability rather than lack of ability to make something more complex. The world is not mapped, and much of it is ruled by monsters, spirits and other strange forces. Gods and demons might walk the world. At the same time there might be few ruins of previous civilisations.

### Early Medieval and Dark ages

This is a classical dark adventuring setting. Many fields of knowledge, sciences for example, are lost. There many ruins of fallen empire. The population density is low. Possibly much of the population is bound in serfdom, keeping labour costs low. On the hand iron-work develops to a higher level, so heavy armour and weapons designed to overcome it begin to develop. Much of the world is not mapped and there are many ruins of civilisations that have been lost to time. Monsters and spirits are still rampant.

### Late, renaissance and industrial age

This is the usual "adventuring guilds" settings. All kinds of weapons and armours are available. Some have become obsolete (under some situations). Firearms become available. Techniques of extracting resources and crafting become very efficient, and all kinds of sciences flourish. Labour costs are high, but productivity of labour also increases due to advanced techniques and industrialisation. Population densities are generally high. Most of the world has been at least crudely mapped. Most ruins have been found and at least some are explored. It is possible that monsters and other "inhuman" forces have retreated (but who knows?).
