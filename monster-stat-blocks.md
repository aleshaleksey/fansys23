Shephard Trees are highly intelligent, but generally benign. That said some will crush outsiders in their forests as humans crush flies. Most shephard trees know Nature, Earth and Water magic to level IV. The eldest Shephard Tree knows Spellcasting: Nature X and know all spells with the "nature" descriptor.

___
## Monsters

Monsters are mortals. They generally breath, eat, drink and sleep, but not all of them do. They are generally predatory and dangerous to humanoids.

When strong trolls and some giants are killed, they have enough vitality that the head, filled driven by anger survives and walks away. These monsters are driven by hatred of those that killed them and constant anger. Even so, they are smart enough to avoid obviously suicidal ventures. No one wants to die.

__
## Spirits: Elementals

Elementals are spirits of the four elements. They are generally immune to physical damage (with the exception of some low level elementals) since the physical form they accrue is in no way necessary for their existence. Likewise they are immune to "stunned", "immobilised", "crippled", "bleeding", poisoned" and "paralysed".

Gnomes are minor earth spirits that manifest as tiny humanoids made of dirt. In small numbers they can be either a boon or hindrance, and seldom cause problems bigger than potholes. Large numbers of angry gnomes have been known to cause landslides.

Gnomes tend to be reclusive and benign. On the other hand they tend to be curious and hospitable to mortals they take a liking to.

**Level 5**: Level 5 skeletons have Multi-attack I.

Skeletons generally obey the will of whoever raised them. Otherwise they take no action unless they notice another mortal, which they will generally attempt to kill. It is thus that skeletons end up spreading from the place that they were raised.

Skeletons are proficient with any tools, weapons and armours they knew in life. They cannot communicate, but can be commanded by way of dark magics.

**Level 5**: Level 5 zombies have Multi-attack I.

Like skeletons, zombies will obey whoever raised them. Otherwise they wonder around searching for mortals to devour.

Zombies are not proficient with anything other than their natural attacks and "grapple". They cannot communicate, but can be commanded by way of dark magics.

**Zombify**: Any mortal bitten once or more by a zombie must make a Con save at midnight. Should they fail, they will become a zombie in 6d12 hours. This disease counts as magic and can oly be cured by supernatural means.

Earthbound shades are lesser incorporeal undead that cannot detach themselves from the earth's surface. Nevertheless they are incredibly dangerous.

NB: Shades are exceptionally dangerous since they cannot be harmed by most weapons and are highly resistant to 3/4 elements. In addition "profane" damage bypasses SP and MP.
