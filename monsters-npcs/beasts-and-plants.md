This represents a large raptor, such as the ones that could be used as cavalry, and not the small, dog sized creatures which are commonly found in bush and woodlands.

Wild raptors dwell on plains and hills and hunt in packs. They prefer smaller prey (including cattle and humanoid caravans), but when hungry have no hesitation when it comes to taking on larger pray, including monsters. Raptors are highly intelligent and have been known to blindside inexperienced humans that come to hunt them.

Raptors are valued as fearsome mounts, but also for their tough hides, which have numerous uses.

Most shephard trees know Nature, Earth and Water magic to level IV. The eldest Shephard Tree knows Spellcasting: Nature X and know all spells with the "nature" descriptor.
