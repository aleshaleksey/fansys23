This represents a large raptor, such as the ones that could be used as cavalry, and not the small, dog sized creatures which are commonly found in bush and woodlands.

Wild raptors dwell on plains and hills and hunt in packs. They prefer smaller prey (including cattle and humanoid caravans), but when hungry have no hesitation when it comes to taking on larger pray, including monsters. Raptors are highly intelligent and have been known to blindside inexperienced humans that come to hunt them.

Raptors are valued as fearsome mounts, but also for their tough hides, which have numerous uses.

___
## Plants

Plants mostly produce nourishment from air, water, minerals and sunlight. Some, however, supplement this with the flesh of other mortals. Plants breathe, drink and eat. Plants do not sleep. Plants are immune to "frightened", "blinded", "stunned", "catatonic" and "paralysed".

|Noxious Spores|Threshold=19 vs CON||(secondary action) 15ft Cone, 90 degree angle, main action. A mortal "hit" by the Tuber's spores must succeed a CON save or become incapacitated at the start of its turn. At the start of its next turn it must succeed a second CON save. If it succeeds this save it takes 2d6 necrotic[NAT] damage and is cured of the effect. Otherwise it falls unconscious 1 hour (no repeated save)|
|Engulf|||(main action) An orc eating tuber can enter the space of an unconscious mortal of a size no larger than "medium" and begin engulfing it. It engulfs the volume of a small entity per main action. This means that it takes 8 rounds to engulf a medium sized entity. An entity at least half engulfed by the tuber is considered "[immobilised](../10-conditions-types.md#conditions-in-detail)".|
|Absorb|Threshold=19 CON|2d6+4 necrotic[NAT]|An entity at least half engulfed by the tuber must make a CON save at the start of its turn or take damage. On success it takes half. A target unconscious due to the noxious spores can then wake up if it succeeds on a save vs the spores.|

|Xenophonia|||"Humanoids", "Animals", "Monsters"|

Orc Eating Tubers release hallucinogenic pollen from their dazzling red flowers. This pollen has the effect of incapacitating or charming its prey. The tuber can speak in many tongues and invites mortals to approach it. As its prey approaches, the tuber releases a noxious gas from its main body which sends its prey to sleep. The tuber then slowly absorbs its unconscious prey.

Orc Eating Tubers are quite intelligent, despite appearance.

Elder Shephard Trees are ancient beings that dwell deep in wild forests. Known by some as the "King of the Forest", they look on as ages go by.

Shephard Trees are highly intelligent, but generally benign. That said some will crush outsiders in their forests as humans crush flies. Most shephard trees know Nature, Earth and Water magic to level IV. The eldest Shephard Tree knows Spellcasting: Nature X and know all spells with the "nature" descriptor.
