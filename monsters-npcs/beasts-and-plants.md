Crocodiles are an ancient, semi-aquatic predator that dwells in warm rivers, swamps, lakes and sometimes even coastal waters. They often spend time on the shore, sunbathing. They prefer murky waters where they can easily ambush birds and mammals that enter the water or loiter within the distance of a lunge. A crocodile will attempt to drag its prey into the water, where it cannot fight back effectively, and might easily drown. On the other hand they are likely to release prey that fights back vigorously.

Elephants are heavy herbivorous mammals that stand about 10ft tall and often weight over 10,000lb. They have prehensile snouts (trunks) and an intelligence which is not far below that of humanoids.

Elephants dwell in herds and range widely. They are not necessarily aggressive (except males in heat), although they do defend their young fiercely. In combat they generally take one of two strategies. Either they form a defensive ring around their young, to ward off predators, or form a wide line and charge as a single front, hoping to trample their foes underfoot.

|Loot|||Snake meat is edible to humanoids, the skin can be used for leather (5lb of meat, 1lb of hide)|

This block represents a venomous cobra. Cobra mainly hunt rodents and other small animals. They use their hypnotic hood to fascinate their prey, and then bite them once and wait for the venom to paralyse the hapless rodent before eating them. Cobras act aggressively in self defence, often pre-emptively killing humanoids they encounter just in case.

Cobra venom makes these snakes extremely dangerous. Especially to solitary travellers which it may leave defenceless for long enough for something else to finish it off.

Seals are mammals that dwell on the coast and spend most of their time  in the water, hunting fish, and occasionally other marine life. Seals seldom attack larger animals, but a seal's size and strength is somewhat comparable to that of a bear so they are capable of doing so.

Seals are pack animals, and are both intelligent and inquisitive. This stat block can be used for seals, sea lions and, tentatively, walruses.

Reef sharks are "smaller" sharks that hunt in the complex terrain of reefs and other shallow waters. They prefer smaller prey, but in large numbers may attack prey larger than themselves.

|Loot|||A reef shark can provide up to about 2000lb of meat.|

Greater sharks are the larger sharks that prowl the oceanic expanse (although some also hunt in the shallows). 

They take both smaller and larger prey, but often prefer mammals, such as seals, that swim near the surface and are outlined by the light from the surface. Greater sharks usually attack by charging up from the depth and delivering a vicious bite. It then circles, waiting for its prey to bleed out. As with smaller sharks, they occasionally congregate in packs to hunt larger prey.

Sharks possess a sense that allows them to feel the electric fields of other living beings, which is invaluable for hunting in murky waters.If

Giant crocodiles are an apex predator that will hunt just about anything that enters the estuaries, lakes, and rivers where it makes its home. They can live for centuries, sleeping for months, or even years, through times of scarcity. Giant crocodiles are sometimes mistaken for [earthbound dragons](monsters-and-dragons.md#earthbound-dragon-lesser), however they possess non of the intelligence or supernatural abilities.

Giant bears are generally docile, but can be incredibly aggressive when hungry or defending their cubs. They are omnivorous, and fond of berries, tubers (including [Orc Eating Tubers](#orc-eating-tuber)), but are not against supplementing it with the meat of slow moving monsters and other giant animals if they have a good chance of taking them down (they are a natural predator of giant snails).

Giant bears can climb trees, but most trees will not support the weight of a fully grown giant bear.

Raptors are predatory, bipedal dinosaurs, thought to hunt in packs, and possessing a single wicked claw on each talon-like foot.

This represents a large raptor, such as the ones that could be used as cavalry, and not the small, dog sized creatures which are commonly found in bush and woodlands.

Wild raptors dwell on plains and hills and hunt in packs. They prefer smaller prey (including cattle and humanoid caravans), but when hungry have no hesitation when it comes to taking on larger pray, including monsters. Raptors are highly intelligent and have been known to blindside inexperienced humans that come to hunt them.

Raptors are valued as fearsome mounts, but also for their tough hides, which have numerous uses.

Plants mostly produce nourishment from air, water, minerals and sunlight. Some, however, supplement this with the flesh of other mortals. Plants breathe, drink and eat. Plants do not sleep. Plants are immune to "frightened", "blinded", "stunned", "catatonic" and "paralysed".

Orc Eating Tubers release hallucinogenic pollen from their dazzling red flowers. This pollen has the effect of incapacitating or charming its prey. The tuber can speak in many tongues and invites mortals to approach it. As its prey approaches, the tuber releases a noxious gas from its main body which sends its prey to sleep. The tuber then slowly absorbs its unconscious prey.

Orc Eating Tubers are quite intelligent, despite appearance.

Elder Shephard Trees are ancient beings that dwell deep in wild forests. Known by some as the "King of the Forest", they look on as ages go by.

Shephard Trees are highly intelligent, but generally benign. That said some will crush outsiders in their forests as humans crush flies. Most shephard trees know Nature, Earth and Water magic to level IV. The eldest Shephard Tree knows Spellcasting: Nature X and know all spells with the "nature" descriptor.
