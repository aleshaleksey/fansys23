# Constructs
Constructs are life-like devices that are capable of movement and are generally made of minerals or metals. They are sometimes called "living dolls", although this term is not strictly correct. Constructs do not reproduce, breathe, drink, eat, sleep or age (unless they are made from mortals).

These properties make constructs excellent workers and guardians.

## Robots
**Robots** are "natural" constructs, typically made by mortals. In the worlds where they exist, they are the height of non-magical artifice. Since they are merely complex machines, robots lack a spirit and thus have no Cha. Robots that are capable of emulating emotion use Int for Cha rolls. A robot that gains a spirit becomes a golem.
- Robots are immune to: "Frightened", "charmed", "surprise", "diseased", "poisoned", "bleeding", "incapacitated" and "dying".
- Robots are resistant to "physical" damage.

___
## Golems
**Golems** are "supernatural" constructs. Typically they are created for tasks which mortals cannot accomplish due to the frailness or limited lifespan of mortal beings. Golems typically continue to carry out these tasks long after their creators pass on.
- Golems are immune to: "Frightened", "charmed", "surprise", "diseased", "poisoned", "bleeding", "stunned" "incapacitated", "catatonic" and "dying".
- Golems are at least resistant to "physical" damage and all "energy"[Nat] damage.

Clay golems are the simplest of golems. They are often used as guardians by journeyman mages, more often as workers than guardians, although they can also fulfil that function.

A clay golem has a near-human intelligence, but no will of its own and follows its master's instructions to the best of its ability. If given no instructions it continues the last task until it is complete. It will defend its master unless explicitly instructed not to.
