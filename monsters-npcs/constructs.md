# Constructs
Constructs are life-like devices that are capable of movement and are generally made of minerals or metals. They are sometimes called "living dolls", although this term is not strictly correct. Constructs do not reproduce, breathe, drink, eat, sleep or age (unless they are made from mortals).

These properties make constructs excellent workers and guardians.

## Golems
**Golems** are "supernatural" constructs. The methods of their construction, like most things supernatural, defy the laws of nature. Typically they are created for tasks which mortals cannot accomplish due to the frailness or limited lifespan of mortal beings. Golems typically continue to carry out these tasks long after their creators pass on.
- Golems are immune to: "Frightened", "charmed", "surprise", "diseased", "poisoned", "bleeding", "stunned" "incapacitated", "catatonic" and "dying".
- Golems are at least resistant to "physical" damage and all "energy"[Nat] damage.

### Gingerbread Golem
Gingerbread golems, also known as gingerbread men are usually small or tiny pastries animated with magic. They are not generally particularly dangerous.

Stone golems are more difficult to construct than clay golems, but they are also more potent. They have a use as guardian golems and war golems, since the effort of constructing them is offset by their increased utility. Its immunity to slashing and piercing weapons makes it especially useful against conventional armies.

A stone golem has a near-human intelligence, but no will of its own and follows its master's instructions to the best of its ability. If given no instructions it continues the last task until it is complete. It will defend its master unless explicitly instructed not to.

### Jade Golem, beast
Jade golems are sometimes known as "Sage's Horse" or "Sage's Shield". They are not superior to ordinary stone golems in terms of toughness, but the material is more closely associated with supernatural energies, so powerful mages often create them for particular purposes, a common purpose is as a mount.

Bestial Jade golems are often used as mounts by rulers and powerful mages. They are less physically potent than regular stone golem and significantly more difficult to enchant. However, their affinity for the supernatural makes them more suitable for service with those who are particularly likely to encounter supernatural energies. They are particularly valued by those paladins and exorcists who are sufficiently well off or well connected to obtain one.

Mithril golems are needlessly difficult to craft. However, they are supreme as weapons of war go. Faster and tougher than stone golems, they are almost impossible to destroy without weapons made of the highest grade materials, or powerful magics. In battle Mithril golems are best used to bombard enemy fortifications with huge fortifications with huge boulders, or clean out large swathes of dense formations with its elemental blast. However it can also be used to enter melee and directly destroy enemy manpower. They are also effective in countering lesser golems and monsters which would otherwise be a danger to one's own forces. Smaller golems of this type are occasionally used as honour guard for the rulers of magocracies.

A mithril golem has a near-human intelligence, but no will of its own and follows its master's instructions to the best of its ability. If given no instructions it continues the last task until it is complete. It will defend its master unless explicitly instructed not to.

Simply spoken, diamond golems are the pinnacle of artifice. Incredibly difficult and impractical to create, they are likewise almost impossible to destroy and incredibly rare. When used, it is generally as guardians of sacred sites, otherworldly portals and dangerous seals.

A diamond golem has a human-like intelligence, but no will of its own. It follows its master's instructions to the best of its ability. If given no instructions it continues the last task until it is complete. It will defend its master unless explicitly instructed not to.

___
## Robots
**Robots** are "natural" constructs, typically made by mortals. In the worlds where they exist, they are the height of non-magical artifice. Since they are merely complex machines, robots lack a spirit and thus have no CHA. Robots that are capable of emulating emotion use Int for Cha rolls. A robot that gains a spirit becomes a golem. 

In general, robots cannot be created or maintained without advanced technologies which are generally lost in most fantasy settings. In general they were created by lost civilisations.
- Robots are immune to: "Frightened", "charmed", "surprise", "diseased", "poisoned", "bleeding", "incapacitated" and "dying".
- Robots are resistant to "physical" damage.

___
### Caretaker Bot, lesser
Caretaker bots are created, as the name suggests, to take care of locales or equipment. They are capable of rudimentary repair and cleaning functions, and can generally manipulate small objects. Occasionally they possess defensive functionality along with the instructions for its use. If the object that a caretaker bot is charged with protecting is threatened it will more likely protect it by summoning more capable guards or, if it is small enough, move it to a safer location, than engage the threat directly. Caretaker bots are generally made of long lasting materials that do not require much maintenance. Caretaker bots are seldom humanoid in appearance, as other forms are often more conducive to its function.

As with all robots, they cannot be created or maintained without advanced technologies which are generally lost in most fantasy settings.

### Caretaker Bot, greater
Greater caretaker bots are similar in purpose to smaller caretaker bots but they are used for looking after large structures or facilities. Likewise they can be used for agriculture or disaster management. They are able to build and rebuild structures and simple machines. While they are not primarily made for combat, the size of these machines makes them dangerous if their instructions include guarding, or exclude preservation of mortal lives. Caretaker bots are seldom humanoid in appearance, as other forms are often more conducive to its function.

As with all robots, they cannot be created or maintained without advanced technologies which are generally lost in most fantasy settings.

### Robotic Horror
Sometimes a robotic soldier is not enough. There are records of robotic machines created specifically for killing. Sometimes for killing humanoids, sometimes for killing monsters that its creators could not hope to face. Robotic horrors can no longer be built in most settings, but perhaps can be found in the depths of ancient ruins.

As with all robots, they cannot be created or maintained without advanced technologies which are generally lost in most fantasy settings.
