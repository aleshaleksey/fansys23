# Divines

Divine entities are a category of supernatural beings that include gods, god-like beings, angels, and anomalies in creation.

## Angels

**Angels** are the creations of gods, or manifestations of creation itself. They are generally created as messengers and observers, but also occasionally enforcing the will of their creator. Not all angels have free will (Cha). Not all angels align with the typical human understanding of "good" (especially the messengers of dark gods).
- All angels have true sight, can discern truth from lie.
- Angels takes 1HP damage whenever they lie. Some are incapable of lying.
- Angels are immune to "light" damage and vulnerable to "profane" damage.
- Angels have advantage on attacks against "Profanes".

The abilities and knowledge an angel is endowed with depends on the purpose it was created with. Often an angel will be endowed with divine abilities that it should not have the prerequisites for.

Lesser angels do not have free will and use WIS in place of CHA for skills.

Lesser messengers are generally sent to material realms to deliver important news, instructions an warnings to mortals of significance. The fact that a greater angel is not sent, should not be seen as a sign that the message is not important. The fact that a messenger is sent at all should be noticed as significant. They are also sometimes sent to guide mortals to a destination, be it physical or figurative.

Lesser messengers prefer to avoid combat and will not retaliate against attacks that are not capable of obstructing their mission. If a threat is capable of obstructing its mission, the angel will incapacitate it, if possible by ridding it of the means, otherwise by using ranged attacks with its rays of light. Only in combat with profane entities will a lesser messenger strike the 'killing' blow.
