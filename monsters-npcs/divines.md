- [Seraph](#seraph)

## Angels

**Angels** are the creations of gods, or manifestations of creation itself. They are generally created as messengers and observers, but also occasionally enforcing the will of their creator. Not all angels have free will (Cha). Not all angels align with the typical human understanding of "good" (especially the messengers of dark gods).
- Divine entities do not need to breath, drink, eat, or sleep, but are often capable of doing so. They do not age.
- Divine entities are immune to all "natural" damage and resistant to "divine" damage.
- They are immune to "surprised", "charmed", "frightened", "stunned" and "dying".
- All angels have true sight, can discern truth from lie.
- Angels takes 1HP damage whenever they lie. Some are incapable of lying.
- Angels are immune to "light" damage and vulnerable to "profane" damage.
- Angels have advantage on attacks against "Profanes".
- Angels do not suffer from fatigue. Thus, an angel can march or fly even when a mortal would tire and require rest.

The abilities and knowledge an angel is endowed with depends on the purpose it was created with. Often an angel will be endowed with divine abilities that it should not have the prerequisites for, were it a mortal or player character.

Lesser angels take on the form of small winged humanoids do not have free will and use WIS in place of CHA for skills.

Lesser messengers are generally sent to material realms to deliver important news, instructions an warnings to mortals of significance. The fact that a greater angel is not sent, should not be seen as a sign that the message is not important. The fact that a messenger is sent at all should be noticed as significant. They are also sometimes sent to guide mortals to a destination, be it physical or figurative.

Lesser messengers prefer to avoid combat and will not retaliate against attacks that are not capable of obstructing their mission. If a threat is capable of obstructing its mission, the angel will incapacitate it, if possible by ridding it of the means, otherwise by using ranged attacks with its rays of light. Only in combat with profane entities will a lesser messenger strike the 'killing' blow.

A watcher exists to watch over an area, entity or event. Often they have a directive to not interfere. Generally they use an alternate form to hide their true nature.

The true form of a watcher generally appears to a mortal as a single eye, surrounded by any a multitude of wings, or a winged serpent, though other forms can exist. Watchers seldom take on that form in the material realm.

A watcher seldom engages threats that do not interfere with its mission, or those that are not capable of damaging it. Nor do they retaliate against attacks not capable of harming them. On occasion, the discovery of a watcher will jeopardise its mission. In that case those who discovered it may be eliminated, depending on the kind of god the watcher serves. When watchers engage in combat, they generally aim to eliminated all threats swiftly using Razor Wind, Elemental Blast (large radius) or divine strike as appropriate. If this is not possible, a watcher will use weather control and superior mobility to chip away at their foes over a period of time.

Watchers have free will. Some sages believe that belies the true purpose of their vigil.

Seraphs are angels that are closest to the deity that created them. In general a seraph is sent to punish those who have gone against the god who sent it, or to prepare an area for a new beginning by bringing flaming destruction upon it. Alternatively, the coming of a seraph may portent the completion of an old prophecy, or the beginning of a new one.

The true form of a seraph appears to mortals generally appear as a head surrounded by six fiery wings, or as a burning wheel.

On missions of prophecy, a seraph generally appears in its true form. On missions of destruction and renewal, it may appear in its bestial form to observe and warn the mortals they are sent to punish before appearing in their true form and delivering judgement.

In combat with a single target, a seraph will often make liberal use fo its divine strike to destroy its foe. On missions of destruction, it will generally rain flaming destruction on a wide area, either using its holy light, or by global ["forest of flame"](../08-spell-list.md#forest-of-flame). Unlike most angels, it will punish those that interfere with its mission, whether their interference is capable of disrupting it or not.

A seraph likely has some degree of free will. Sages believe that this is an element of divine judgement.
