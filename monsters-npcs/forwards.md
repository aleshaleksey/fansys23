The bestiary contains stat blocks to various NPCs and monsters that can be used in the game. The stat blocks contain all the characteristics of an entity that are covered by the game rules, and usually a brief description of how it normally behaves, and even a little about its nature. This should allow the DM and players to use the entities described therein as units in, and out of, combat. Groups are under no obligation to follow the suggested behaviours or canon origins for the entities, and are encouraged to modify and make their own stat blocks to fit the worlds they play in.
