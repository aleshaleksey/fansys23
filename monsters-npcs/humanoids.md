|Proficiencies|||Any two tools or kits|
|Skills|-|-|Usually +2 to tinker, appraise or fortify and +1 to insight or a knowledge|
|Loot|||Usually 1-4sp and the clothes on their back|

The human commoner block represents the average civilian townfolk found in urban environments, as well as peasants and slaves whose roles in society do not involve much hard labour.

These humans seldom own weapon or armour, although some are proficient in a single weapon group.

These humans generally prefer to get on with their lives and avoid trouble, but often lack the knowledge of what that trouble looks like. They will usually sooner surrender and beg for their lives than fight overwhelming foes. No one wants to die.

___
### Human Peasant
|HiT|SP|MP|HP|Speed (walk)|Speed (other)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|11|13|6|3|30ft|-|

(+1 from base)

|Proficiencies|||Any two tools or kits|
|Skills|-|-|Usually +3 fortify, +2 to harvest, +1 to any one from the "sense" group|
|Loot|||Usually the tools of their trade, and clothes on their back.|

This represents any human that works in hard manual labour as well as frontier-dwellers such as farmers, trackers and bandits.

These humans are often proficient in any two weapon groups, though seldom own battlefield weapons, preferring a trusty axe, staff or hunter's bow.

Beware the humble human farmer working his field! He has had a tough life and survived. A peasant will not rush into combat, but will often be more than willing to defend his pride, home and kin. Still they would rather not have to. No one wants to die.

### Human Elite
|HiT/Surprised/Touch|SP|MP|HP|Speed (walk)|Speed (other)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|

|||||
|Skills|||Has a +5 in deception, +5 in academics and 2 knowledge, "navigate" +4, +3 in persuade and sense motive|

These are well fed humans who are trained from birth to rule over their societies. They seldom fight, but often send others to fight for them. They will generally surrender once they have ran out of men to throw at their foe, or even before then. No one wants to die.

Elites seldom carry weapons or wear armour beyond a symbolic dagger or smallsword. Although if forced onto the battlefield will take up arms.

### Human Militia
|HiT/Surprised/Touch|SP|MP|HP|Speed (walk)|Speed (other)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|16/13/14|20|8|5|30ft|-|

(+1 from base)

The HiT includes +2 from padded armour and +2 from a light shield.

|Shortbow|+4|1d6+1 piercing|-|
|Crossbow|+4|1d10+1 piercing|-|
|Proficiencies|||Two melee, one ranged, shield, medium armour|
|Skills|-|-|Usually +5 Athletics, +3 climb, fortify, +2 to any two from the "sense" group, "navigate" +2|

Militia block can be used for town guard or town militia, although frontier hunters and bandits also use this block. Ordinary soldiers, such as hoplites, levied for a campaign should use this stat block.

A militiaman seldom carries more than one or two of the weapons listed. A town guard patrolling the streets might carry a mace, while one patrolling the road for monsters might carry a spear. The frontier hunter might carry a shortbow and dagger, while a gate guard might sport a crossbow.

Militiamen will normally perform their combat duty, but will break and flee if the odds are overwhelming. No one wants to die.

|Skills|||+7 "athletics", +5 "fortify" and "climb". +3 "swim", +4 to "observe" and "sense motive".|
|Loot|||All his stuff and 10-400sp|

This represents a seasoned veteran of many campaigns who devotes his life to war. Still if he sees himself hopelessly outmatched by one who is not his sworn enemy, he will likely surrender. No one wants to die.

This block can also represents guard captains, monster hunters and other humans who have devoted their lives to violence.

A warrior usually carries one heavy weapon weapon and a sidearm. He may also carry a ranged weapon. He usually has an attendant, or at least a pack animal.

A knight is an elite warrior, trained from birth to fight and rule. This block can also represent generals and kings who lived their life on the battlefield.

A knight usually has a warhorse, squire and attendants. Like a warrior, he will carry a main weapon and shield into battle and carry a side arm. Knights seldom carry ranged weapons, trusting their heavy armour to protect and squire (stat as [militiaman](#human-militia)) to back them up.

The spell threshold for a magic knight is Threshold=19 (INT)

This represent an elite mystic warrior trained in sword and magic. Paladins, captains of inquisitorial orders, mage-hunters and battle mages all fall within this category. Leaders of nations in tune with the supernatural, religious orders and some cults may also be "magic knights".

A magic knight will usually have an apprentice and servant. They may have a warhorse. A magic knight will carry a longsword and shield. Magic knights seldom carry ranged weapons, trusting their magics.

In combat a magic knight will attack its foes perceived weakness. A magic knight will fight to the death if their goal necessitates it, but will otherwise retreat if overwhelmed. Magic knights are generally loath to surrender.

___
### Human Magic Knight Variant: Elemental Knight

An elemental knight works like a Magic Knight with the following differences:
- INT=12
- WIS=16
- Replace "Spell Strike" with "Elemental Blast" (fire or ice).
- Replace "Incantation" and "kinetic" with two elemental magics of choice.

The spell threshold for a magic knight is Threshold=19 (WIS)

Elves live for a ridiculously long time. This stat block represents an elf that has lived for 100 years or less.

An ordinary elf will seldom carry weapons beyond a dagger for no reason. These elves will seldom try to start a fight, preferring to hide and observe. If threatened they prefer to accept the terms and obtain revenge later if there is any risk. No one wants to die.

The average elf has lived for centuries and has had time to learn an incredible range of skills. This thus represents your average elf.

An average elf will carry a sling and knife for self defense, knowing that the world is more dangerous than it appears. They seldom enter combat unless there is a strict necessity for it. No one wants to die.

This represents a millennia old elf. They have likely seen civilisations rise and fall. If they ever had friends amongst shorter lived mortals, then they have likely passed on long ago. This entity has a terrifying wealth of experience. This block can represent an elvish king, or some traveller who has wondered the earth for longer than he can remember. Either way, this is an extremely dangerous opponent.

Elvish elders seldom carry much on their journeys. They will almost never engage in combat (how else does one live this long). However, should an inevitable threat appear, they will attempt to eradicate it in the most effective manner. They will not fight fair or put themselves in danger unless absolutely necessary. No one wants to die.

This block represents an elite warrior/scout who hunts down evil creatures and enemies of elven-kind, be they monsters that hunt people, or people who hunt elves.

A hunter carries only what they need to exist autonomously and hunt down their pray. A hunter prefers to remain hidden and kill from afar, if necessary using magic to deceive, mislead and otherwise gain the upper hand. A hunter makes maximum use of "sniper" and "aphonic spell" to avoid detection. They will use "silence" to shut down enemy spellcasters. Killing prey when it sleeps or is otherwise weak is most preferable. However, if they must they will fight up close using their superior speed to inflict a death by a thousand cuts.

**NB**: Do not use this stat block unless you intend to kill the party, or know that they have a very good capacity when it comes to detecting hidden foes.

This represents an elf who has devoted several centuries to learning spellcraft.

An elvish mage will generally leave the scene as soon as it senses that a fight might be inevitable. However, they will defend themselves, their apprentices and their brethren fiercely. In those cases they will use communication magic to warn allies, before using appropriate magics. Elven mages are generally weary for counter-spelling mages.

This represents your average orc. This could be a tribesman, hunter, bandit or artisan. Orcs tend to live tough lies in harsh and dangerous parts of the world, which makes them a little tougher than the average human human.

An orc might have a lower threshold for violence than an average human, but he will generally not fight a pointless or unwinnable fight. No one wants to die.

This block does not represent an orc who goes hunting, but rather one that has devoted its life to the hunt. This could be a monster hunter or a hunter of men.

An orcish hunter generally runs down its pray, herding it into traps and finishing it off with blows of its fists. When taking down dangerous pray much larger than itself, it will rely on massive axes to neutralise the size advantage.

This represents an orc that has devoted its life to war. Much like a human knight, it is raised for violence and rulership.

A berserker longs for battle and bloodshed. It will usually fight to the death.

NB: Be careful when throwing this block at the party.

Geomancers are mages devoted to nature and earth magic.

An orcish geomancer will not fight unless necessary, but takes great joy in destroying its foes if it does fight. That said, a geomancer will usually surrender if it sees that it is defeated.

The winged have long since guided flocks of birds on their migration routes. Some of those flocks ended up following their shepherds. As a result, a tradition of these nomads has emerged.

This block also represents militia, patrol, and the tougher Winged travellers that one may find on the "road".

Winged Shepherds prefer to avoid conflict. When they fight, they fight to delay their enemies for long enough to make an escape. No one wants to die.

The task of a scout is to fly and observe. A scout may be there to find those Winged who were blown of course, or to find wandering monsters, or keep track of marching armies.

Winged scouts will sooner flee than fight, unless there is something that must be defended. Even then when the objective has been defended, the Winged will usually disengage.

This block represents a high level wind mage (anemancers). These are Winged who are beloved by the winds and learn wind magic from an early age. They are raised to become the rulers and protectors of their people.

A wind mage tries to avoid battle. However if it cannot be done, they will attempt to prepare the battlefield with global magic. If attackers are terrestrial, the wind mage will mercilessly use fire and air magic to reduce them before the battle. Unlike most winged, wind mages will do their best to finish off a threat permanently if it can be done without too much risk.

This represents an ordinary beast folk. It can also represent guards, enforcers and militia (although in that case expect them to use hide armour and spears).

Beast folk often dwell in wilder parts of the world, and much like orcs, tend to be a little tougher than ordinary humans. Given the wide range of situations they encounter, they often learn a wide range of skills. Beast folk of more aggressive lineages have no compunctions against conflict and violence, but will not fight to the death unless their kin is threatened.

Common beast folk are often proficient with fighting tooth and claw and one form of ranged weapon. They seldom carry weapons unless they anticipate that they will need it.

This represents merchants, emissaries, messengers and other experienced wayfarers. They prefer to solve their problems through dialogue, though will fight if the situation necessitates it. If they face death, they will usually surrender.

In combat, a beast folk traveller, will attempt to put some distance between themselves and targets and attack from afar. If this seems unlikely to work, they will flurry with tooth and claw, trying to take out their target as quickly as possible.

This stat block represents a veteran beast folk warrior, who has fought in many campaigns, or hunted monsters in the wilderness for years. They are found in elite units or as leaders of mercenary bands, or even as solitary figures who roam the wilds.

A warrior generally uses brigandine for armour, although might use any medium armour. Generally they will carry a few war darts or javelins. If they are hunting monsters, or expecting a large combat, they will carry spears to negate the advantage of numbers of foes or the size of monsters.

A beast folk warrior prefers to approach its foe stealthily and then rush the foe and take it down with multiple strikes of its claws. Otherwise it prefers hit and run tactics before closing in for the kill. Beast folk warriors will retreat if victory is outside their reach, but they will generally die before surrendering to other humanoids.

A mystic warrior can represent a master of martial arts who has trained for decades in a hidden temple, or a warrior who has travelled to the spirit realm to obtain knowledge that is ordinarily forbidden to mortals. This may be a high level assassin, spy, bodyguard or diplomat. Whichever it is, one should note that the stat block reflects an NPC of much higher ability level than a baseline "mook".

A mystic warrior might carry a quarter staff or a greatbow, but is usually capable of handling most threats without weapons. Most mystic warriors will generally prefer to get what they want through dialogue, but are not averse to the use of force.

In combat a mystic warrior prefers hit and run tactics, making good use of its combat manoeuvres and "debilitating strike" to disable dangerous opponents. If it has thе opportunity to do so, it will harry enemies with its greatbow before closing in.

## Goblins
Goblins are little green humanoids which are cast as villains in many fantasy worlds. They are sly, cowardly and weak, uninventive and petty, greedy and spiteful. Goblin societies are depicted as primitive, unsophisticated and simultaneously unjust and unequal. Goblins are often used in low level adventures as monsters that are easy to defeat even for low level characters. Contrariwise, it is not advisable to use goblins in this way.

___
## Giant
There is some debate as to whether giants are humanoids, monsters or an entirely different category of mortals. Regardless, giants are not visually much different from ordinary humanoid, apart from their impossible size. Giants stand at least 10ft tall and can reach be much much bigger. Giants, like mortals, eat, drink, sleep and generally age. They are born, reproduce and occasionally die. Giants often live for hundreds or even thousands of years.

Ogres are a typically mean spirited and poor tempered giant. They have near human intelligence, but tend to rely on their strength, forming only rudimentary societies, and seldom developing sophisticated technologies or magics unless guided or integrated into other civilisations. Ogres tend to be gluttonous and lascivious and are seldom shy about obtaining what they wish by force.

Ogres seldom fight unless they are sure of victory. Unfortunately for them, strength and size is the main measure of power. Ogres tend to attack en masse and under the cover of darkness. Ideally they attempt to ambush, surround and charge. Occasionally ogres will attack smaller humanoids when on their own. However, such solitary ogres  will seldom take on well armed groups.

Ogre mages are ogres that have been opened the secrets of the spirit realm, perhaps by birth, gift or through their travels. Occasionally they obtain their magic through pacts with dark powers. Ogre mages are generally motivated by more esoteric questions than lesser ogres, but they do retain their carnal natures. Due to their genuine power, ogre mages tend to lead groups of ogres, or even become warlords of small kingdoms. Ogre mages can be reasoned and bargained with, although one should have some means to enforce the bargain, or risk being crossed by the ogre.

Ogre mages prefer to have others fight for them while they watch from a safe distance, but if necessary they will join a combat. Generally an ogre mage will use weather control magic to cover an area with mist, or wind blown rain, as this reduces the effectiveness of ranged attacks, and makes ambushes easier. They will then support their subordinates with elemental magic. Only as a last resort, or should victory seem inevitable will it engage into melee.

Giants are not necessarily particularly fierce. Many know a single elemental or nature magic to at least level II. If inclined to fight, they will use their magic to increase their already formidable strength, and then use their great size and strength to beat down their foe. They will often destroy fortifications made by the smaller races with javelins that strike with the force of a small ballista, which they use to hurl small boulders. A giant's booming voice can be heard for miles, should it choose to project it, and villagers in mountain valleys will often hear their their songs.

Contrary to many myths, most giants are neither foolish, nor slow witted. Over their lifespan, giants often gain many a skill, and a traveller would often be wise to learn from a giant should they encounter one.

Giants are not necessarily particularly fierce. Giant warriors on the other hand are. These are the giants who have gone out of their way to hone the martial abilities. A giant warrior may be cruel or righteous, but generally takes great pride in its prowess. A giant warrior is an opponent to dragons, demons and some of the other great monsters that roam the world. A single one of these warriors is generally capable single handedly wiping out a small army.

While giant warriors have various tactics, most spend centuries mastering unarmed combat, turning their enormous bodies into the deadliest of weapons.

When facing single opponents a giant warrior will try to close and restrain the target and then beat it into a literal pulp.

When facing multiple opponents, they will generally attempt to identify and disable any mages capable of debuffs, followed by those who are capable of dealing direct damage to it.

When facing armies, they will use protective magics to reduce the effects of projectile weapons, followed by the use of its bow to thin out dangerous units at a distance. Only then does it close. Its aim is generally to break the enemy by inflicting massive casualties to its heaviest units. If it is particularly outnumbered it will attempt to use terrain traps to increase the density of enemy units as much as possible, since its fists become particularly deadly in those cases. Some giant warriors wear lighter armour and carry a long-axe for the occasion. The 15ft foot reach on a giant's long axe allows a giant to devastate dense formations.

___
### Colossus
A colossus (or Titan) is to a giant what a giant is to man. It can be as small as 100ft tall, or as tall enough to walk with its head in literal clouds. A colossus in the land of humanoids is worshipped as a god or scorned as a natural disaster. While giants often take interest in the fate of small folks, for a colossus they are often but insects. A colossus is as likely to ignore a lesser mortal as it is to squash it like a bug. A colossus is not a force that ordinary mortals can hope to fight. In most worlds colossi, much like ancient dragons, are either sleeping, sealed or extinct.

What is the purpose of a colossus? What is its goals? What is its nature? That varies from world to world. In some they are the tools the gods used to create the world, in others they are the tools they will use to destroy it. In others still they have a different role entirely.

It is not often that a titan engages in battle. In most cases it does not rush. There is no such thing as an insignificant foe. Insignificant foes are ignored or crushed in an instant. They are sealed or subverted. A combat is only when a foe is significant.

A colossus will prepare the battlefield with "[Lesser Weather Control](../08-spell-list.md#lesser-weather-control)" and "[Balance of Elements](../08-spell-list.md#balance-of-elements)" to disable the long range capabilities of its foes and increase the effectiveness of its own magics. At that point it will attack directly, either using its elemental abilities to decimate collected foes, or its enormous form to physically destroy single strong foes.

When dealing with highly mobile foes that use long ranged attacks that exceed the range of a ~6MP dice elemental blast, a colossus will generally summon air elementals to hunt it down. Otherwise it may use teleportation to close the distance to gain an advantage.
