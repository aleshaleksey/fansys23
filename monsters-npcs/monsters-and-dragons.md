This monster dwells in cracks in dry rocks and exudes a sweet smell to attract prey. When beasts or humanoids approach it oozes out of the cracks and attempts to make contact with its prey, subduing it with its poisonous touch before dissolving it.

These oozes are themselves devoured by some kinds of fungus, and as such they prefer dry climates.

A mudcrawler has a crab-like carapace that covers a flattened round body of 1-2ft across. It also has a variable number of multi-hinged, insect-like legs. On the underside of its body it has a single orifice.

Young mud-crawlers hide beneath the soft mud of lake beds and other waterlogged wetlands, and listen for vibrations. When potential prey passes overhead, the death-crawlers emerge from the ground and attack their pray en mass, stabbing it with their claw, and once it stops moving, it attaches and devours it, injecting its digestive juices into the victim. mud crawlers, being creatures prefer humanoid victims. Every so often, a colony of mudcrawler matures.

|Monster Attack|||A corpse stork makes one beak attack and one claw attack as a main action|
|Corpse Mimicry|||A corpse stork can, as a secondary action, interact with a humanoid corpse with more or less intact lungs to mimic its voice. To recognise this as an impersonation, a character must succeed an "observe" roll (Thr=18) at disadvantage. Even if it does not succeed, the observer might be suspicious when they sees the Corpse Stork next to the corpse.|
|Skills|||"Fly" +6, "Observe" +4, "Perform" +5|
|Loot|||The quills of corpse storks are particularly valued, but alchemists generally value their innards. The flesh of these monsters, however, is often infested with all kind of parasites.|

These huge bird-like monsters hunt primarily humanoids. They hunt their prey by poisoning them with their needle-like feathers and one they confirm that they are weakened, descend to finish them off. Once they have at least one corpse, they inflate its chest with its tail, causing it to mimic the voice it had in life. This creates an illusion of the corpse calling for help, which acts to lure more humanoid prey to the Corpse Stork. The Corpse Stork both feasts on the flesh and lays its eggs in it.

|Telepathy|||(Range=120ft)|
|Resistance|||"Poi" damage, "poisoned", physical damage|

Hive beasts are highly intelligent telepathic predators that dwell in the dark corners of the world. Undoubtedly, hive beasts are more intelligent than most humanoids, but for some reason never found civilisations as do humanoids. It is likely that the principles under which they operate are too different.

Hive beasts are telepathic, and while they do not found civilisations, they do form colonies. They guard their territory jealously against other hive beasts. When hive beasts fight or hunt, they do so in perfect coordination, as they essentially share a single mind amongst them. Their mental capacity aside, hive beasts have an appropriately monstrous physical prowess. Their claws being particularly vicious.

Hive beasts are dangerous, not because of their individual strength, but because should you encounter one, you will likely have to deal with the whole colony.

Fell beasts are predatory monsters that roam hilly and mountainous terrain. They prefer humanoid flesh, but will settle with animals, and in poor times even plants and other monsters.

Fell beasts have four limbs, all with sharp claws, as well as powerful jaws. Adults have a venomous sting with a poison that gradually paralyses its victim. Not being particularly stealthy, they stalk their pray until nightfall, or when it enters narrow ravines and wooded groves, at which point they attack, generally in packs of 2-12.

Young fell beasts prefer to use trees and cliffs to their advantage, leaping onto prey from unexpected angles, while elder fell beasts, becoming heavy, prefer waterways. With age, the hide of a fell beast becomes thick enough to resist spears, arrows, claws and fangs.

Fell beasts easily navigate complex terrain and have been known to track their prey for weeks.

When strong trolls and some giants are killed, they have enough vitality that the head, filled driven by anger survives and walks away. These monsters are driven by hatred of those that killed them and constant anger. Even so, they are smart enough to avoid obviously suicidal ventures. No one wants to die.

A tunnel hound is a 15ft long monster with short legs, a flexible back, and sharp teeth, that is about 6ft tall and 6ft wide. Typically they wander the corridors of catacombs or natural caves in search of prey. On occasion, creative generals release them into enemy fortresses through breaches in the outer walls, where they wreck havoc on the inhabitants with minimal losses for the attacking army.

A tunnel hound's age can be determined by its length. Beware of long tunnel hounds.

Giant snails are large herbivorous molluscs. Demonic snails are monsters that crawl over the land devouring anything that approaches them. They shoot venomous teeth attached to extensible pseudopods at their prey, causing paralysis. They then devour their prey at their leisure.

Contrary to their name, these monsters are not demons.

A very dangerous otherworldly monster. The Worm that Sings is has a slender, mushroom-like body with a flat head and towers 15ft as it stands. It wonders remote and sparsely inhabited lands, with no obvious goal, singing a haunting song as it goes, that is capable of ensnaring mortals. Mortals ensnared by the song either stand motionless and allow the worm to implant its eggs in it, which hatch within a month, beginning to devour the victim as they mature. Others become violent and attempt to strike nearby beings, even close friends.

Worms that sing are thought to be capable of spellcasting. Those that encounter them speak of enthralling stories of ages past and ages that are to come, of other places on this world and of other worlds.

A troll only dies permanently if its HP is 0 or below, and this ability is inactive.|
|Limited Immunity|||"crippled": A troll that suffers from the "crippled" condition is cured of it at the start of its next turn, as it regenerates. If a troll's "extraordinary vitality" is disabled by any means, this ability likewise ceases to function|
|Senses|||"Keen senses", "low light vision"|
|Skills|||+5 to any 2, +4 to any two (usually knowledge arcana, track, nature)|

Trolls are a giant-like monsters with extraordinary vitality and an insatiable lust for humanoid flesh. They stand 10-20ft tall, walk on two legs and have two (or sometimes more) arms that end in sharp, blade-like claws. Their teeth are likewise a vicious weapon. Trolls can use weapons, but seldom do. While they are cunning predators, smart enough to deceive, lure and ambush, they are typically slow witted. Trolls will typically hide and ambush potential prey. They can sometimes be negotiated with, though they seldom value anything more than a good meal.

Trolls have the ability to recover swiftly from even fatal wounds. They have been known to reassemble themselves after having been chopped into mincemeat. They can only truly be killed if the wounds are seared with "fire" or "divine" energies, or if they are disintegrated by "entropic" forces. As a result trolls are seemingly willing to fight to the death against impossible odds. They are quick to reconsider this position upon encountering those who wield energies that are truly capable of destroying them.

A mudwalker looks a lot like a mudcrawler but a lot larger, towering over 30ft tall. When a mudcrawler has matured sufficiently, one crawler will devour the rest and mature into a much larger and more dangerous monster. Mudwalkers are enormous monsters that seek out humanoid settlements so that it can use its populace as nourishment for its young, that they may grow and continue the cycle.

Mudwalkers seldom directly attack humanoids. Instead they release a noxious gas from their enormous shelled bodies. However, if they find humans that fight back, they attempt to skewer them with their sharp limbs.

A kraken is essentially a very big and very intelligent cephalopod-like monster. While younger krakens simply wonder the seas in search of prey and meaning, the elder ones generally (and erroneously) come to the conclusion that they are gods.

A kraken has an enormous amount of time to learn magic. It seldom uses it in combat, but it *can*, should it choose. Storms at sea are sometimes attributed to this monster.

A griffon has the head and wings of a giant eagle of a lion. It is a proud and intelligent predator. Sometimes humanoids steal their eggs to raise them as mounts, but breeding and training griffons is extremely difficult and lengthy, so it is rare for griffons to be used as mounts.

Griffons hunt by diving down onto its prey and breaking its back. If it's prey is not killed by the initial attack, the griffon carries it up into the air and drops it from a height before repeating the process. Griffons are fiercely territorial and attempt to drive off interlopers. If they cannot do so with warning displays, they will generally do so by tearing apart the intruders. Griffons will even attack much larger and stronger prey, but will only fight to the death in such a case if they are defending offspring.

A hippogriff is a griffon is a being with the front of an eagle, and the back of a horse. In this sense, it is much like a griffon. Unlike griffons, they are somewhat weaker fliers, but stronger runners.

Hippogriffs are seldom natural beings, but result in the breeding of a male griffon with a mare. Like griffons, they are difficult to raise and train.

The owl-griff is homage to the "owl-bear" of DnD fame. It is usually a vicious monster created by magic, with the front of an owl, and the rear end of a bear.

These monsters are violent and difficult to escape as they can run, fly, climb and swim.

A minotaur, half-bull half man, is said to be the product of the insatiable lust of humankind. A minotaur is traditionally found in a dark labyrinth where it makes its home and enjoys the taste of human flesh, though perhaps there are other interpretation.

In combat a minotaur's tactics are simple: Charge. That said, before attacking it may stalk its foes through its labyrinth until it is exhausted, or drops its guard.

A unicorn is a horse-like being with a single straight horn upon its forehead. It runs faster than a horse, and unlike a horse has human-like intelligence and potent magic.

Unicorns dislike humanoids and may either flee or attack them on sight. They make an exception for those humanoids they consider innocent and pure, and may even heal such humanoids or allow them onto their back.

A unicorn prefers to avoid combat, but should it be sufficiently provoked, it will use its significant arcane potential to annihilate its foes. It is particularly merciless against fiends.

OPTIONAL:
- When a unicorn is killed for its horn or hunted for pleasure, it is reborn as a [Black Unicorn](profanes.md#unicorn-black) within the year.
- Every 7th unicorn that sacrifices itself in the defence of innocence, is reborn as a [True Unicorn](divines.md#unicorn-true) within the year.

## Lycanthropes

Sometimes humanoids because afflicted by the curse of Lycanthropy. It can be obtained by crossing divine beings associated with the moon, or angering ancient nature spirits, or perhaps from the bites of other lycanthropes. Regardless, a lycanthrope gains incredible fortitude at the expense of losing its mind and humanoid form under the influence of the full moon. In their bestial form and under the influence of their madness, lycanthropes are incredibly dangerous, and take pleasure in violence and suffering. Often this affects those they love the most.

Lycanthropes are classified as "Mortals", "Monsters".

The following is common to lycanthropes:

- Lycanthropes are immune to "physical" damage.
- Lycanthropes are at least resistant to "Poi" and "disease".
- Lycanthropes have an alternate form of a beast (though this is never a herbivorous beast). Less powerful lycanthropes have little control over this transformation.
- Lycanthropes' "Pi" and "Sl" immunities are negated by weapons made of silver.

A greater werewolf is a terrible foe, if it is indeed a foe that possesses all the powers and hunting instincts of its lupine form, combined with the human intellect. Greater werewolves can be alphas of werewolf packs or lone creatures. They can lords, or they can be servants of yet greater powers.

## Dragons

Dragons typically look like reptiles, but are not. Dragons are supernatural entities with 6 or more limbs (of which 2 or more typically wings) and scales. They have an Int of at least 10. Dragons typically have obscenely long lifespans and possess the following characteristic features:

- Like most mortals, dragons breathe, drink and eat.
- A dragon's eye can see through illusions.
- Dragons have an "elemental" organ, which allows them to exhale energy, typically fire.
- Dragons need sleep.
- Dragons are an apex lifeform and as such are immune to fear.
- Dragons are immune to one element.
- Dragons are resistant to "slashing", "Sh" and "Pe" damage.
- Some, but not all, dragons are shapeshifters, capable of taking on the forms of animals or humanoids.

Dragons, in most worlds, are the apex mortal being. They are typically stronger, more robust and more intelligent than most other mortals. In addition they possess a whole array of potent supernatural abilities. Most dragons are spellcasters. As such this raises the very valid question of why do dragons not rule all the worlds where they are present?

Aside from hand-waving the question away, there can be a whole number of reasons.

- Dragons reproduce and grow slowly, so their numbers might not be enough to control whole civilisations the world over.
- In most settings they spend most of their lives sleeping, probably due the enormous metabolic costs of activity for their enormous forms.
- They do, they'r just magically disguised as humanoids and so most people, other than those who are kept in a constant state of fear, or discredited as madmen, are not aware of the fact.

Likewise, settings where dragons *do* rule the world are completely plausible.

When using dragons, one should take into account their intelligence and vast experience that comes with age. A dragon *might* be arrogant to the extent of underestimating dangers and overconfident due to its power, but it would also be smart enough to recognise when something is not right, and to have backup plans and strategies for those events. In addition, it is not beyond reason that a dragon might have minions or summons that it would use, possibly as expendable resources.

Depending on world, a flame dragon can either be a vicious creature bent on wholesale destruction, a guardian of elemental nodes of fire, a reclusive hoarder, a keeper of ancient and forbidden lore, or something else entirely. A dragon pursues its goals and objectives with the mindset of a being that has millennia at its disposal, and will seldom move quickly, unless its hand is forced. It may choose to deal with mortals if it suits its goals or fancy.

Regardless of world, a flame dragon is a formidable entity. If it wishes to avoid an encounter it has a number of spells, starting from "Lesser Veil" and ending in "Greater Cosmic Seal" and "Meteoric Flight" to do so. Its lair might be a castle it previously sacked, the caldera of an active volcano, or something else entirely. It will likely be guarded by minions or bound fire elementals, and hidden at the end of a secret path. The weather around it will likely be altered in order to make it more or less accessible as the dragon wishes.

If it knows that a combat is inevitable, it will likely prepare the ground with "Balance of Element", or "Forest of Flame". It will almost certainly prepare a secret path for a potential escape route if appropriate.

Alternatively it may strike first, and depending on its aim and opponent, employ varying strategies.

- A dragon does not fight on the ground, or in small spaces, unless there is a very good reason to do so, as this negates many of the advantages its flight gives it.
- If the purpose is intimidation or domination, it will generally attack from above, devastating its opponents with its fire breath and pyromancy, and only descend and finish the fight in a demonstrative melee, making liberal use of "broad strike" if it faces multiple foes.
- If a dragon truly wishes to destroy or obtain something it will usually infiltrate through a secret path, or "travel by flame", or in one of its alternate forms. In most cases, it will open up with "Forest of Flame" or a breath attack. If its opponent has particularly dangerous abilities, it will use "Isolate Essence" to seal them before proceeding.
- A dragon that wishes to protect something, will prefer to sequester it and place numerous magical seals upon it, although it may equally leave the task to minions.
- Dragons generally prefer using force over a negotiated solution (due to their overwhelming power and nature), but they can be reasoned with, and will occasionally make bargains when it suits them.
- A dragon will seldom fight to the death, but when it realises that it faces a life threatening situation, it will use its abilities to deadly effect. A dragon will occasionally surrender or accept defeat, but never at the expense of its pride and never if it means domination/enslavement by another being.

Lesser dragons are weaker and smaller than their brethren, and yet they are still dragons. Depending on setting, they may be "lesser" due to age, or for some other setting specific reason.

A lesser dragon is significantly weaker in melee than its more powerful brethren, and thus must be craftier and more careful when engaging. It is more likely to use trickery, or use harrying attacks and magic to first wear down potential foes.

Frost Dragons are often less aggressive than Flame Dragons, and their reasons for violence are often more complex and nuanced. Depending on world, they may be self appointed guardians of the ruins left by forgotten civilisations, hermits in great stretches of frozen wilderness or heralds of the changing seasons.

For the most part, the reasons why a Frost Dragon might fight are not dissimilar to why a [Flame Dragon](#flame-dragon-normal) might fight. Likewise, their tactics fundamentally have many parallels.

The devil, however, is in the details. A Frost Dragon is slower and stronger than its flaming cousin, as such, it is even more deadly in melee, where its attacks are powerful enough to rend most armour. Its affinity for elemental magic is also distinct. Whether on the offensive or defensive, it uses its weather control magic to weaken foes over days or weeks before striking, using the cover of storms to then crush its weakened opponents. Frost drakes may be less likely to burn down whole towns, again preferring to slowly suffocate them with unending ice storms without ever initiating direct combat.

Its mastery of water magic grants it the ability to [scry](../08-spell-list.md#scry) on its surrounds or hide its lair with [illusions](../08-spell-list.md#mirage) and it uses both abilities liberally.

Earthbound dragons lack the breath attacks of their flying kin. They live in far away corners of the world. In the deepest caverns. In the most overgrown jungles. In the most hidden of mountain valleys. These dragons are forsaken by the skies but blessed by the earth upon which they dwell.

An earthbound dragon may be a guardian of the elemental nodes of earth or territories closely associated with the earth element. They may be guardians of nature. They can be grave-keepers of lost civilisations or the watchers of portals to other worlds. They are more likely to be benevolent than malevolent, although this is, of course, setting specific.

Whatever its motives, a dragon pursues its goals and objectives with the mindset of a being that has millennia at its disposal, and will seldom move quickly, unless its hand is forced. It may choose to deal with mortals if it suits its goals or fancy.

Earthbound dragons are formidable opponents, even though they lack flight and the usual dragon breath. It will use its considerable intelligence and centuries of experience to the best of its ability. It will use gnomes and earth elementals in order to keep it appraised of potential threats and dispatch golems to neutralise them if appropriate. Its lairs are guarded by ["Greater Cosmic Seal"](../08-spell-list.md#greater-cosmic-seal) and ["Greater Domain"](../08-spell-list.md#greater-domain) as well as lesser spells. If combat is inevitable, it will prepare with ["False Regrowth"](../08-spell-list.md#false-regrowth) before engaging.

In combat an earthbound dragon studies its opponents and strikes quickly and mercilessly.

- It will use spells such as "slumber" and "dusk" to its advantage.
- It will use narrow spaces together with its dig speed to strike foes from below. It will not fight in wide open spaces, or beneath the open sky unless it must.
- It will use spells such as down to knock down flying opponents, and is quite capable of attacking it with boulders, thrown with the force of a trebuchet.
- Only when its opponents are weakened, does it close in and use its devastating jaws to attempt to settle a battle.
- If a dragon truly wishes to destroy or obtain something it will usually infiltrate through a secret path, or "travel by flame", or in one of its alternate forms. In most cases, it will open up with "Forest of Flame" or a breath attack. If its opponent has particularly dangerous abilities, it will use "Isolate Essence" to seal them before proceeding.
- A dragon that wishes to protect something, will prefer to sequester it and place numerous magical seals upon it, although it may equally leave the task to minions.
- Dragons generally prefer using force over a negotiated solution (due to their overwhelming power and nature), but they can be reasoned with, and will occasionally make bargains when it suits them.
- A dragon will seldom fight to the death, but when it realises that it faces a life threatening situation, it will use its abilities to deadly effect. A dragon will occasionally surrender or accept defeat, but never at the expense of its pride and never if it means domination/enslavement by another being.
