## Monsters

Monsters are mortals. They generally breath, eat, drink and sleep, but not all of them do. They are generally predatory and dangerous to humanoids.

|Bite|+4|1d3+2[Shear]|The imp's bite contains a poison. The target must succeed a Threshold=14 CON save *immediately* when hit. If it fails, then it suffers from "aphonia". The aphonia lasts for an hour. It also becomes "immobilised" *at the end of its turn*. The save is repeated at the start of every turn. Upon success, victim is no longer affected by "immobilised", but the "aphonia" remains.|
|Mimicry|||A motionless Cradle Imp is nigh indistinguishable from a plus toy. However, the difference is detectable with "Truesight" or a Threshold=17 observe roll, by entities with "Keen Senses: Scent" or "Heat-sense".

A mudcrawler has a crab-like carapace that covers a flattened round body of 1-2ft across. It also has a variable number of multi-hinged, insect-like legs. On the underside of its body it has a single orifice.

Young mud-crawlers hide beneath the soft mud of lake beds and other waterlogged wetlands, and listen for vibrations. When potential prey passes overhead, the death-crawlers emerge from the ground and attack their pray en mass, stabbing it with their claw, and once it stops moving, it attaches and devours it, injecting its digestive juices into the victim. mud crawlers, being creatures prefer humanoid victims. Every so often, a colony of mudcrawler matures.

Fell beasts are predatory monsters that roam hilly and mountainous terrain. They prefer humanoid flesh, but will settle with animals, and in poor times even plants and other monsters.

Fell beasts have four limbs, all with sharp claws, as well as powerful jaws. Adults have a venomous sting with a poison that gradually paralyses its victim. Not being particularly stealthy, they stalk their pray until nightfall, or when it enters narrow ravines and wooded groves, at which point they attack, generally in packs of 2-12.

Young fell beasts prefer to use trees and cliffs to their advantage, leaping onto prey from unexpected angles, while elder fell beasts, becoming heavy, prefer waterways. With age, the hide of a fell beast becomes thick enough to resist spears, arrows, claws and fangs.

Fell beasts easily navigate complex terrain and have been known to track their prey for weeks.

When strong trolls and some giants are killed, they have enough vitality that the head, filled driven by anger survives and walks away. These monsters are driven by hatred of those that killed them and constant anger. Even so, they are smart enough to avoid obviously suicidal ventures. No one wants to die.

It must make 3 Con saves, one at the end of the day, one after 7 days, one after 30 days. After failing a save, the target loses 1 Con (can be cured by a complete rest with medical treatment) and gains +1 to Int. If the target fails all three saves it becomes a young worm.|

|Resistance|||"percussive", "pressure", "light", "ice", "necrotic"|
|Vulnerability|||"entropic"|

A very dangerous otherworldly monster. The Worm that Sings is has a slender, mushroom-like body with a flat head and towers 15ft as it stands. It wonders remote and sparsely inhabited lands, with no obvious goal, singing a haunting song as it goes, that is capable of ensnaring mortals. Mortals ensnared by the song either stand motionless and allow the worm to implant its eggs in it, which hatch within a month, beginning to devour the victim as they mature. Others become violent and attempt to strike nearby beings, even close friends.

Worms that sing are thought to be capable of spellcasting. Those that encounter them speak of enthralling stories of ages past and ages that are to come, of other places on this world and of other worlds.

A mudwalker looks a lot like a mudcrawler but a lot larger, towering over 30ft tall. When a mudcrawler has matured sufficiently, one crawler will devour the rest and mature into a much larger and more dangerous monster. Mudwalkers are enormous monsters that seek out humanoid settlements so that it can use its populace as nourishment for its young, that they may grow and continue the cycle.

Mudwalkers seldom directly attack humanoids. Instead they release a noxious gas from their enormous shelled bodies. However, if they find humans that fight back, they attempt to skewer them with their sharp limbs.

___
## Dragons
Dragons typically look like reptiles, but are not. Dragons are supernatural entities with 6 or more limbs (of which 2 or more typically wings) and scales. They have an Int of at least 10. Dragons typically have obscenely long lifespans and possess the following characteristic features:
- Like most mortals, dragons breathe, drink and eat.
- A dragon's eye can see through illusions.
- Dragons have an "elemental" organ, which allows them to exhale energy, typically fire.
- Dragons need sleep.
- Dragons are an apex lifeform and as such are immune to fear.
- Dragons are immune to one element.
- Dragons are resistant to "slashing", "shear" and "bludgeoning" damage.
- Some, but not all, dragons are shapeshifters, capable of taking on the forms of animals or humanoids.

Dragons, in most worlds, are the apex mortal being. They are typically stronger, more robust and more intelligent than most other mortals. In addition they possess a whole array of potent supernatural abilities. Most dragons are spellcasters. As such this raises the very valid question of why do dragons not rule all the worlds where they are present?

Aside from hand-waving the question away, there can be a whole number of reasons.
- Dragons reproduce and grow slowly, so their numbers might not be enough to control whole civilisations the world over.
- In most settings they spend most of their lives sleeping, probably due the enormous metabolic costs of activity for their enormous forms.
- They do, they'r just magically disguised as humanoids and so most people, other than those who are kept in a constant state of fear, or discredited as madmen, don't know.

Likewise, settings where dragons *do* rule the world are completely plausible.

When using dragons, one should take into account their intelligence and vast experience that comes with age. A dragon *might* be arrogant to the extent of underestimating dangers and overconfident due to its power, but it would also be smart enough to recognise when something is not right, and to have backup plans and strategies for those events. In addition, it is not beyond reason that a dragon might have minions or summons that it would use, possibly as expendable resources.

Depending on world, a flame dragon can either be a vicious creature bent on wholesale destruction, a guardian of elemental nodes of fire, a reclusive hoarder, a keeper of ancient and forbidden lore, or something else entirely. A dragon pursues its goals and objectives with the mindset of a being that has millennia at its disposal, and will seldom move quickly, unless its hand is forced. It may choose to deal with mortals if it suits its goals or fancy.

Regardless of world, a flame dragon is a formidable entity. If it wishes to avoid an encounter it has a number of spells, starting from "Lesser Veil" and ending in "Greater Cosmic Seal" and "Meteoric Flight" to do so. Its lair might be a castle it previously sacked, the caldera of an active volcano, or something else entirely. It will likely be guarded by minions or bound fire elementals, and hidden at the end of a secret path. The weather around it will likely be altered in order to make it more or less accessible as the dragon wishes.

If it knows that a combat is inevitable, it will likely prepare the ground with "Balance of Element", or "Forest of Flame". It will almost certainly prepare a secret path for a potential escape route if appropriate.

Alternatively it may strike first, and depending on its aim and opponent, employ varying strategies.
- A dragon does not fight on the ground, or in small spaces, unless there is a very good reason to do so, as this negates many of the advantages its flight gives it.
- If the purpose is intimidation or domination, it will generally attack from above, devastating its opponents with its fire breath and pyromancy, and only descend and finish the fight in a demonstrative melee, making liberal use of "broad strike" if it faces multiple foes.
- If a dragon truly wishes to destroy or obtain something it will usually infiltrate through a secret path, or "travel by flame", or in one of its alternate forms. In most cases, it will open up with "Forest of Flame" or a breath attack. If its opponent has particularly dangerous abilities, it will use "Isolate Essence" to seal them before proceeding.
- A dragon that wishes to protect something, will prefer to sequester it and place numerous magical seals upon it, although it may equally leave the task to minions.
- Dragons generally prefer using force over a negotiated solution (due to their overwhelming power and nature), but they can be reasoned with, and will occasionally make bargains when it suits them.
- A dragon will seldom fight to the death, but when it realises that it faces a life threatening situation, it will use its abilities to deadly effect. A dragon will occasionally surrender or accept defeat, but never at the expense of its pride and never if it means domination/enslavement by another being.
