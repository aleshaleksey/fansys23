A mudcrawler has a crab-like carapace that covers a flattened round body of 1-2ft across. It also has a variable number of multi-hinged, insect-like legs. On the underside of its body it has a single orifice.

Young mud-crawlers hide beneath the soft mud of lake beds and other waterlogged wetlands, and listen for vibrations. When potential prey passes overhead, the death-crawlers emerge from the ground and attack their pray en mass, stabbing it with their claw, and once it stops moving, it attaches and devours it, injecting its digestive juices into the victim. mud crawlers, being creatures prefer humanoid victims. Every so often, a colony of mudcrawler matures.

A very dangerous otherworldly monster. The Worm that Sings is has a slender, mushroom-like body with a flat head and towers 15ft as it stands. It wonders remote and sparsely inhabited lands, with no obvious goal, singing a haunting song as it goes, that is capable of ensnaring mortals. Mortals ensnared by the song either stand motionless and allow the worm to implant its eggs in it, which hatch within a month, beginning to devour the victim as they mature. Others become violent and attempt to strike nearby beings, even close friends.

Worms that sing are thought to be capable of spellcasting. Those that encounter them speak of enthralling stories of ages past and ages that are to come, of other places on this world and of other worlds.

A mudwalker looks a lot like a mudcrawler but a lot larger, towering over 30ft tall. When a mudcrawler has matured sufficiently, one crawler will devour the rest and mature into a much larger and more dangerous monster. Mudwalkers are enormous monsters that seek out humanoid settlements so that it can use its populace as nourishment for its young, that they may grow and continue the cycle.

Mudwalkers seldom directly attack humanoids. Instead they release a noxious gas from their enormous shelled bodies. However, if they find humans that fight back, they attempt to skewer them with their sharp limbs.
