## Profane: Undead

Undead are mortals that died but failed to move on. They are cursed by creation and driven to destroy or oppose it in some way. Undead do not breath, sleep. They are vulnerable to "divine" damage. However they are immune to "disease", "unconscious", "dying", "stunned", "charmed", "frightened" and "paralysed" and "resistant" to "physical" damage.

As all profane entities, undead do not sleep or breath, and most do not age, eat or drink.

|Scream|Threshold=15 CON save||As a secondary action, the horror can issue a pained shriek (1 SP dice). Any entity within 30ft that hears the shriek must make a Threshold=15 WIS save or become "frightened" of the horror. An entity can repeat its save at the start of each of its turn.

A corporeal horror is produced when incomplete remains are animated together, producing a single whole. These undead often retain the vestiges of the memories of the mortals they comprise of. However, it is rare for them to show true intelligence. Due to the processes involved, a corporeal horror can take seemingly contradictory actions as it is driven simultaneously by a desire for release and the desire for others to meet a fate worse than its own.

**Level 5**: Level 5 skeletons have Multi-attack I.

Skeletons generally obey the will of whoever raised them. Otherwise they take no action unless they notice another mortal, which they will generally attempt to kill. It is thus that skeletons end up spreading from the place that they were raised.

Skeletons are proficient with any tools, weapons and armours they knew in life. They cannot communicate, but can be commanded by way of dark magics.

**Level 5**: Level 5 zombies have Multi-attack I.

Like skeletons, zombies will obey whoever raised them. Otherwise they wonder around searching for mortals to devour.

Zombies are not proficient with anything other than their natural attacks and "grapple". They cannot communicate, but can be commanded by way of dark magics.

**Zombify**: Any mortal bitten once or more by a zombie must make a Con save at midnight. Should they fail, they will become a zombie in 6d12 hours. This disease counts as magic and can oly be cured by supernatural means.

Cursed shades are incorporeal undead. They are the vestiges of those who died cursing their own existence. Nevertheless they are incredibly dangerous.

NB: Cursed Shades are extremely dangerous as profane damage attacks HP directly.

Earthbound shades are lesser incorporeal undead that cannot detach themselves from the earth's surface. Nevertheless they are incredibly dangerous.

NB: Shades are dangerous since they cannot be harmed by most weapons and are highly resistant to 3/4 elements.

___
## Fiends
**Fiends** are entities opposed to creation or mortal-kind. In realms where they exist, devils and demons are fiends. Sometimes divine entities fall and become fiends. Fiends that do not reach minus their total HP from "divine" damage will be reborn elsewhere, at another time (hence cycles of dark lord and heroes).

Fiends do not breath, sleep or age, but some eat/drink. Fiends are vulnerable to "divine" damage, and are resistant to "physical", "fire", "ice", "lightning" and "light" damage. They are immune to "disease" and "poison" as well as "unconscious" and "dying".

|5|Skills|||"Fortify:+7", "Intimidate: +3", "Climb:+6", "Spellcraft:3", "Religion:3"|

Minor demons take many forms. The ones described in this stat block resemble, on the material world, the most ugly and wretched of humanoids, although some are capable of supernatural disguise and flight. 

Regardless, they all share the following characteristics: They are almost always, servile, chaotic and destructive. They are only loyal to a master (be it a master or greater demon) for as long as fear, magic or anticipation of destruction hold them.

Invariably minor demons despise creation and are generally sadistic beyond the potential of of most mortals. It is only their powerlessness that prevents them from bing truly dangerous.

Minor demons may be proficient with one or more weapon. In this case they will use the weapon if it increases their lethality.
