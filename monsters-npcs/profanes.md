## Undead

Undead are mortals that died but failed to move on. They are cursed by creation and driven to destroy or oppose it in some way. Undead do not breath, sleep. They are vulnerable to "divine" damage. However they are immune to "disease", "unconscious", "dying", "stunned", "charmed", "frightened" and "paralysed" and "resistant" to "physical" damage.

As all profane entities, undead do not sleep or breath, and most do not age, eat or drink.

## Undead: Corporeal
This section covers undead beings that have a physical body. They may be resistant to some forms of physical damage, but seldom immune. Once the body is destroyed, they usually perish.

A corporeal horror is produced when incomplete remains are animated together, producing a single whole. These undead often retain the vestiges of the memories of the mortals they comprise of. However, it is rare for them to show true intelligence. Due to the processes involved, a corporeal horror can take seemingly contradictory actions as it is driven simultaneously by a desire for release and the desire for others to meet a fate worse than its own.

**Level 5**: Level 5 skeletons have Multi-attack I.

Skeletons generally obey the will of whoever raised them. Otherwise they take no action unless they notice another mortal, which they will generally attempt to kill. It is thus that skeletons end up spreading from the place that they were raised.

Skeletons are proficient with any tools, weapons and armours they knew in life. They cannot communicate, but can be commanded by way of dark magics.

**Level 5**: Level 5 zombies have Multi-attack I.

Like skeletons, zombies will obey whoever raised them. Otherwise they wonder around searching for mortals to devour.

Zombies are not proficient with anything other than their natural attacks and "grapple". They cannot communicate, but can be commanded by way of dark magics.

**Zombify**: Any mortal bitten once or more by a zombie must make a CON save at midnight. Should they fail, they will die and become a zombie in 6d12 hours. This disease counts as supernatural and can only be cured by supernatural means. It cannot be cured once it has run its course. The threshold for diagnosis is 14 within the first 2 hours after infection. More than 2 hours after infection, the threshold is reduced to 8.

## Vampires

Vampires are undead that still have blood in their veins. A vampire is cursed by the sun and requires blood in order to remain active. Thus most vampires are active at night. Vampires cannot cross running water or enter another's dwelling without an invitation. All vampires have vulnerability to "divine" and "light" damage. Furthermore, a vampire that is out in daylight, cannot use any abilities that require the expenditure of SP dice or MP dice. A vampire that is exposed to direct sunlight takes 1 HP damage at the start of its turn. Unlike living beings, a vampire that is starved of blood does not die. Instead it becomes dormant, until it has been fed.

In most settings vampires are beings of intense hunger, both for sustenance (blood) and for carnal pleasures.

This represents an average humanoid that has become a lesser vampire. Potentially the thrall of a greater vampire. In most settings, vampire spawn (lesser vampires) are not truly free and are bound to the existence of their sire.

Vampire spawn tend to retain part of the personality and most of the memories they had in life, but their original sense of values and priorities is seldom preserved.

This represents a full vampire, or perhaps a vampire spawn that has existed for long enough to become a full vampire. This kind of vampire is a dangerous adversary. Vampires can have different sets of abilities. This stat block models a vampire who may have been a noble in a 15-18th style society.

Vampires tend to retain part of the personality and most of the memories they had in life, but their original sense of values and priorities is seldom preserved.

A vampire does not always prefer to choose to attain its goals through violence, but when it does, it will usually first assess its target carefully. It will use charm and deception to strip away allies and resources, before using its own minions to wear down remaining foes. Thereafter, if there is still a need, it will enter combat itself. A vampire may use might, magic, or a combination of both. The personality of vampires varies, but most enjoy humiliating their foes when they are weak and will only fight themselves when they are confident of victory, or have no other choice.

This represents a lord of vampires, or an ancient vampire that has fed on humanoids for millennia. Either case, this is a legendary monster.

Vampires tend to retain part of the personality and most of the memories they had in life, but their original sense of values and priorities is seldom preserved. That said, an ancient vampire that has existed for this long and gained this much power is likely to have moved so far beyond its humanity that it is unrecognisable by any human standard.

A vampire does not always prefer to choose to attain its goals through violence, but when it does, it will usually first assess its target carefully. It will use charm and deception to strip away allies and resources, before using its own minions to wear down remaining foes. Thereafter, if there is still a need, it will enter combat itself. A vampire may use might, magic, or a combination of both. The personality of vampires varies, but most enjoy humiliating their foes when they are weak and will only fight themselves when they are confident of victory, or have no other choice. Alternatively, a vampire lord may just step in directly without any preparation to toy with its victims out of Sh boredom, or any other reason for that mater.

## Undead: Incorporeal

This category comprises mostly ghosts, phantoms, shades and other malicious spirits of once living mortals. They are generally invulnerable to physical damage, and even if they are, they cannot be destroyed permanently by the application of physical force. Their attacks are particularly dangerous since they often drain the vitality, which is much more difficult to protect against than conventional attacks.

## Fiends

**Fiends** are entities opposed to creation or mortal-kind. In realms where they exist, devils and demons are fiends. Sometimes divine entities fall and become fiends. Fiends that do not reach minus their total HP from "divine" damage will be reborn elsewhere, at another time (hence cycles of dark lord and heroes).

Fiends do not breath, sleep or age, but some eat/drink. Fiends are vulnerable to "divine" damage, and are resistant to "physical", "Fir", "ice", "Lig" and "light" damage. They are immune to "disease" and "poison" as well as "unconscious" and "dying".

Imps are tiny fiends. Their potential for evil and destruction is limited only by their limited capability.

An imp accomplishes its goals of undermining creation by corrupting mortals that might associate with them (as familiars but also when not bound). They are also capable of using their powers directly to cause chaos, discord, distrust and direct destruction.

In combat an imp attempts to sneak up on its target and burn it with its flames. It will generally flee if it recognises that it is outmatched.

Minor demons take many forms. The ones described in this stat block resemble, on the material world, the most ugly and wretched of humanoids, although some are capable of supernatural disguise and flight. 

Regardless, they all share the following characteristics: They are almost always, servile, chaotic and destructive. They are only loyal to a master (be it a master or greater demon) for as long as fear, magic or anticipation of destruction hold them.

Invariably minor demons despise creation and are generally sadistic beyond the potential of of most mortals. It is only their powerlessness that prevents them from bing truly dangerous.

Minor demons may be proficient with one or more weapon. In this case they will use the weapon if it increases their lethality.

|Immune|||["biological damage"](../10-conditions-types.md#biological-damage), diseased", "poisoned", "dying"|
|Vulnerability|||"Div" damage, "Lit: supernatural" damage|

When a sentient mortal  has a part of their body wilfully taken from them by another entity, occasionally the attachment and resentment transforms the mortal into a fiend, rematerialising the lost part.

The Shadow flesh fiend seeks to avenge its loss, pursuing its lost body part and the ones who took it relentlessly. It will then return to the place it became a fiend and guard it relentlessly.

A Shadow flesh who has taken its revenge and regained its lost parts ceases to exist, and depending on the world, its soul is able to rest or ceases to exist.

A Shadow Flesh Fiend appears similar to the being it once were, but the profane flesh enhances all of its abilities. Its profane touch drains the vitality of beings it contacts with. In addition, beings slain by the Shadow Flesh Fiend are raised as zombies.

When a shadow flesh fiend is created by removing parts from a being of a being with a spiritual or divine alignment, it may instead become a "[an abyssal blade]".

|Alternate Form|||A succubus has a true form, and a humanoid form. The humanoid form is generally attractive. It can shift between them as a secondary action.

Succubi are fiends that prey on the carnal desires of humanoids in order to drain them of life-force or otherwise corrupt them. They usually take on the form of a desirable mate.

Succubi avoid fighting if possible. They study their target and then use secret paths to approach their targets in a moment of weakness. Potentially during their sleep. A succubus may use their innate charms to succumb a victim, or if this seems unlikely, they will attempt to enchant them. If it requires sustenance it will then use its life drain.

If this strategy appears to be failing, the succubus will generally retreat, using ["Dusk"](../08-spell-list.md#dusk) or ["Lesser Veil"](../08-spell-list.md), or Pr-prepared secret paths.

If a succubus must fight, it will use magic to charm the most combat capable opponent, then obfuscate the battle field and attempt to use its life-drain if it can while using its thrall to protect it.

A fiendish warrior is a being of violence. It relishes violence. It exists to increase the amount of bloodshed and violence in the world, usually by its own hands. It will seek out combat and is drawn to locales with a blood-stained history. Where there is none, it will work to create it. A fiendish warrior is at least as happy slaughtering and tormenting innocents and those who cannot fight back, as it is destroying strong foes.

Physically, it appears as a monstrous humanoid with four arms, and is capable of wielding weapons. However, its claws are also an effective weapon.

While a demon warrior might not relish intrigue and complex strategy, but will attempt to use it is necessary to bring about more bloodshed.

Fiendish warriors are formidable foes. They usually prefer to fight weakened foes, but will not shy away from a difficult combat. A demon warrior will not hesitate to use an opponent's weakness against them, or finish off a downed foe. Equally they may deliberately leave a survivor to spread tales of horror far and wide.

A fiendish warrior will unleash will close in and unleash their destructive aura. Once they do, they will engage in melee.

Some fiendish warriors have wings and can fly at 50ft.

|Demonic Realm|||Each demon has its own demonic realm which is found at least in the intermediate depths of the spirit realm. This acts as a "[Greater Domain](../08-spell-list.md#greater-domain) with a radius of at least 40ft (and with no upper limit), with the exception that its alignment is "profane" and is located deeper in the spirit realm. If the domain is destroyed, the demon is likewise destroyed.|
|Demonic Restoration|||A demon can only be permanently destroyed by "divine" damage or if its demonic realm is destroyed. A demon which is destroyed by other means will be reborn in its domain after an arbitrary amount of time (recommended 13d12 years).|

Demons are greater fiends. They are an incarnation of the forces that wish to despoil and undo creation. A demon of fire (or ice) appears as a horror with at least two legs and at least two arms. It usually has a pair of wings and a bestial head. A demon can shift between this form an a humanoid form (always the exact same humanoid), and will often take on its humanoid form when its demonic form is not suited to a task.

A demon will chose the path that leads to the greatest destruction and tragedy above all, even if it must wait decades or centuries for this outcome. For example, it might save a young child if it can help raise it to be a corrupt king that will lead to the cataclysmic downfall of its kingdom. That said, a demon would prefer a direct bloodbath if this path is available and realistic.

Demons of different elements will likely have slightly different personalities and preferences. A demon of fire is likely to prefer swift and cataclysmic destruction, while a demon of ice may prefer a slow and inevitable decay.

In combat a demon may use any number of strategies. However it especially delights in using a foe's strengths and weaknesses against it. It will not hesitate to use a foe's kindness and mercy against it. Likewise it delights in toying with weaker foes and demonstrating to defeated foes the fruits of their powerlessness. It may even rob defeated foes of that which is precious to them and then let them live to foment hatred and despair.

A demon attempts to keep its demonic realm secret and protected, as the demonic realm is its true form. Should the demonic realm be destroyed, the demon likewise perishes.

A black unicorn is not necessarily black of coat, but black of heart.

A unicorn is a horse-like being with a single straight horn upon its head. Unicorns have a special affinity to virgins. Black unicorns particularly enjoy the taste of flesh of humanoid virgins. It also enjoys the taste of their despair.

These fiends whisper promises of adventure and romance, only to whisk away their victims to fare away, secluded places, and devour them.

Despite their fierce appearance, black unicorns are somewhat cowardly. They will lord over weaker foes that cannot harm them (perhaps even sparing their lives so that they can spread the word of their splendour). When it comes to truly powerful foes, a black unicorn is as likely to flee as it is to fight back.

It should be noted that black unicorns share many healing spells and abilities with the true unicorn. They differ it the fact that they use these abilities for evil.
