## Profane: Undead

Undead are mortals that died but failed to move on. They are cursed by creation and driven to destroy or oppose it in some way. Undead do not breath, sleep. They are vulnerable to "divine" damage. However they are immune to "disease", "unconscious", "dying", "stunned", "charmed", "frightened" and "paralysed" and "resistant" to "physical" damage.

**Level 5**: Level 5 skeletons have Multi-attack I.

Skeletons generally obey the will of whoever raised them. Otherwise they take no action unless they notice another mortal, which they will generally attempt to kill. It is thus that skeletons end up spreading from the place that they were raised.

Skeletons are proficient with any tools, weapons and armours they knew in life. They cannot communicate, but can be commanded by way of dark magics.

**Level 5**: Level 5 zombies have Multi-attack I.

Like skeletons, zombies will obey whoever raised them. Otherwise they wonder around searching for mortals to devour.

Zombies are not proficient with anything other than their natural attacks and "grapple". They cannot communicate, but can be commanded by way of dark magics.

**Zombify**: Any mortal bitten once or more by a zombie must make a Con save at midnight. Should they fail, they will become a zombie in 6d12 hours. This disease counts as magic and can oly be cured by supernatural means.

Earthbound shades are lesser incorporeal undead that cannot detach themselves from the earth's surface. Nevertheless they are incredibly dangerous.

NB: Shades are exceptionally dangerous since they cannot be harmed by most weapons and are highly resistant to 3/4 elements. In addition "profane" damage bypasses SP and MP.
