## Profane: Undead

Undead are mortals that died but failed to move on. They are cursed by creation and driven to destroy or oppose it in some way. Undead do not breath, sleep. They are vulnerable to "divine" damage. However they are immune to "disease", "unconscious", "dying", "stunned", "charmed", "frightened" and "paralysed" and "resistant" to "physical" damage.

As all profane entities, undead do not sleep or breath, and most do not age, eat or drink.

|Scream|Threshold=15 CON save||As a secondary action, the horror can issue a pained shriek (1 SP dice). Any entity within 30ft that hears the shriek must make a Threshold=15 WIS save or become "frightened" of the horror. An entity can repeat its save at the start of each of its turn.

A corporeal horror is produced when incomplete remains are animated together, producing a single whole. These undead often retain the vestiges of the memories of the mortals they comprise of. However, it is rare for them to show true intelligence. Due to the processes involved, a corporeal horror can take seemingly contradictory actions as it is driven simultaneously by a desire for release and the desire for others to meet a fate worse than its own.

**Level 5**: Level 5 skeletons have Multi-attack I.

Skeletons generally obey the will of whoever raised them. Otherwise they take no action unless they notice another mortal, which they will generally attempt to kill. It is thus that skeletons end up spreading from the place that they were raised.

Skeletons are proficient with any tools, weapons and armours they knew in life. They cannot communicate, but can be commanded by way of dark magics.

**Level 5**: Level 5 zombies have Multi-attack I.

Like skeletons, zombies will obey whoever raised them. Otherwise they wonder around searching for mortals to devour.

Zombies are not proficient with anything other than their natural attacks and "grapple". They cannot communicate, but can be commanded by way of dark magics.

**Zombify**: Any mortal bitten once or more by a zombie must make a Con save at midnight. Should they fail, they will become a zombie in 6d12 hours. This disease counts as magic and can only be cured by supernatural means.

## Fiends
**Fiends** are entities opposed to creation or mortal-kind. In realms where they exist, devils and demons are fiends. Sometimes divine entities fall and become fiends. Fiends that do not reach minus their total HP from "divine" damage will be reborn elsewhere, at another time (hence cycles of dark lord and heroes).

Fiends do not breath, sleep or age, but some eat/drink. Fiends are vulnerable to "divine" damage, and are resistant to "physical", "fire", "ice", "lightning" and "light" damage. They are immune to "disease" and "poison" as well as "unconscious" and "dying".

Imps are tiny fiends. Their potential for evil and destruction is limited only by their limited capability.

An imp accomplishes its goals of undermining creation by corrupting mortals that might associate with them (as familiars but also when not bound). They are also capable of using their powers directly to cause chaos, discord, distrust and direct destruction.

In combat an imp attempts to sneak up on its target and burn it with its flames. It will generally flee if it recognises that it is outmatched.

|5|Skills|||"Fortify:+7", "Intimidate: +3", "Climb:+6", "Spellcraft:3", "Religion:3"|

Minor demons take many forms. The ones described in this stat block resemble, on the material world, the most ugly and wretched of humanoids, although some are capable of supernatural disguise and flight. 

Regardless, they all share the following characteristics: They are almost always, servile, chaotic and destructive. They are only loyal to a master (be it a master or greater demon) for as long as fear, magic or anticipation of destruction hold them.

Invariably minor demons despise creation and are generally sadistic beyond the potential of of most mortals. It is only their powerlessness that prevents them from bing truly dangerous.

Minor demons may be proficient with one or more weapon. In this case they will use the weapon if it increases their lethality.

|Claw|+5|1d4+3||
|Grapple|+7||A target grappled by a succubus has disadvantage on saves vs its "charm" and "life drain"|
|Charm|Threshold=21 WIS||As a full round action, a succubus can charm a humanoid. The humanoid is charmed for 24h, but gets a repeated save if it is subject to an attack from the succubus. If the humanoid is not attracted to the sex of the form that the succubus is currently in, it has advantage on the save.|
|Life Drain (1MP dice)|Threshold=21 CHA|1d3 SP dice|The succubus' life drain drains 1d3 SP dice from the target's maximum. The actual SP dice is also reduced by that amount. Each time, the succubus gains 2 SP which can take it past its SP maximum. If the target has 0 SP dice, the attack affects HP instead.|
|||||
|Alternate Form|||A succubus has a true form, and a humanoid form. The humanoid form is generally attractive. It can shift between them as a secondary action. In its humanoid form the succubus loses its claw attack and replaces its movement modalities with those of the humanoid. Its stats, saves, and abilities are unaffected.|
|||||
|Senses|||"Low Light Vision", "Heat Sense", "Life Sense"|
|Spellcasting: Incantation II|Threshold=18||Favourites are: "Down", "Sour", "Least Ward", "Least Vengeance", "Least Veil", "Trace Secret Path"|

|||||
|Resistant|||"physical" damage, "fire", "ice", "lightning" damage|
|Immune|||"disease", "poison", "dying"|
|Vulnerability|||"divine" damage|

Succubi are fiends that prey on the carnal desires of humanoids in order to drain them of life-force or otherwise corrupt them. They usually take on the form of a desirable mate.

Succubi avoid fighting if possible. They study their target and then use secret paths to approach their targets in a moment of weakness. Potentially during their sleep. A succubus may use their innate charms to succumb a victim, or if this seems unlikely, they will attempt to enchant them. If it requires sustenance it will then use its life drain.

If this strategy appears to be failing, the succubus will generally retreat, using "[Dusk](../08-spell-list.md#dusk)" or "[Lesser Veil](../08-spell-list.md)", or pre-prepared secret paths.

If a succubus must fight, it will use magic to charm the most combat capable opponent, then obfuscate the battle field and attempt to use its life-drain if it can while using its thrall to protect it.

A fiendish warrior is a being of violence. It relishes violence. It exists to increase the amount of bloodshed and violence in the world, usually by its own hands. It will seek out combat and is drawn to locales with a blood-stained history. Where there is none, it will work to create it. A fiendish warrior is at least as happy slaughtering and tormenting innocents and those who cannot fight back, as it is destroying strong foes.

Physically, it appears as a monstrous humanoid with four arms, and is capable of wielding weapons. However, its claws are also an effective weapon.

While a demon warrior might not relish intrigue and complex strategy, but will attempt to use it is necessary to bring about more bloodshed.

Fiendish warriors are formidable foes. They usually prefer to fight weakened foes, but will not shy away from a difficult combat. A demon warrior will not hesitate to use an opponent's weakness against them, or finish off a downed foe. Equally they may deliberately leave a survivor to spread tales of horror far and wide.

A fiendish warrior will unleash will close in and unleash their destructive aura. Once they do, they will engage in melee.

Some fiendish warriors have wings and can fly at 50ft.

|Demonic Realm|||Each demon has its own demonic realm which is found at least in the intermediate depths of the spirit realm. This acts as a "[Greater Domain](../08-spell-list.md#greater-domain) with a radius of at least 40ft (and with no upper limit), with the exception that its alignment is "profane" and is located deeper in the spirit realm. If the domain is destroyed, the demon is likewise destroyed.|
|Demonic Restoration|||A demon can only be permanently destroyed by "divine" damage or if its demonic realm is destroyed. A demon which is destroyed by other means will be reborn in its domain after an arbitrary amount of time (recommended 13d12 years).|

Demons are greater fiends. They are an incarnation of the forces that wish to despoil and undo creation. A demon of fire (or ice) appears as a horror with at least two legs and at least two arms. It usually has a pair of wings and a bestial head. A demon can shift between this form an a humanoid form (always the exact same humanoid), and will often take on its humanoid form when its demonic form is not suited to a task.

A demon will chose the path that leads to the greatest destruction and tragedy above all, even if it must wait decades or centuries for this outcome. For example, it might save a young child if it can help raise it to be a corrupt king that will lead to the cataclysmic downfall of its kingdom. That said, a demon would prefer a direct bloodbath if this path is available and realistic.

Demons of different elements will likely have slightly different personalities and preferences. A demon of fire is likely to prefer swift and cataclysmic destruction, while a demon of ice may prefer a slow and inevitable decay.

In combat a demon may use any number of strategies. However it especially delights in using a foe's strengths and weaknesses against it. It will not hesitate to use a foe's kindness and mercy against it. Likewise it delights in toying with weaker foes and demonstrating to defeated foes the fruits of their powerlessness. It may even rob defeated foes of that which is precious to them and then let them live to foment hatred and despair.

A demon attempts to keep its demonic realm secret and protected, as the demonic realm is its true form. Should the demonic realm be destroyed, the demon likewise perishes.
