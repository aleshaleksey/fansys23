## Spirits: Elementals

Elementals are spirits of the four elements. They are generally immune to physical damage (with the exception of some low level elementals) since the physical form they accrue is in no way necessary for their existence. Likewise they are immune to "stunned", "immobilised", "crippled", "bleeding", poisoned" and "paralysed".

Flame Sprites are the most dangerous of minor elementals. They are playful material spirits associated with fire and consisting of it. Despite their playfulness, their propensity to ignite everything they touch and step on as they dance, makes them extremely dangerous, even when they do not have hostile intent.

In combat, the touch of a Flame Sprite is in itself dangerous, but it prefers to avoid melee and relies on its pyromancy. Flame sprites fight without fear on the material realm. They often toy with mortals with["Least Pyromancy"](../08-spell-list.md#least-pyromancy), ["Enflame"](../08-spell-list.md#enflame) and ["Foxfire"](../08-spell-list.md#foxfire). In combat, however they will harass foes with ["Ignition"](../08-spell-list.md#ignition) and cast ["Meadow of Flame"](../08-spell-list.md#meadow-of-flame) once their foes are within range.

Gnomes are minor earth spirits that manifest as tiny humanoids made of dirt. In small numbers they can be either a boon or hindrance, and seldom cause problems bigger than potholes. Large numbers of angry gnomes have been known to cause landslides.

Gnomes tend to be reclusive and benign. On the other hand they tend to be curious and hospitable to mortals they take a liking to.

In combat they prefer to use ["Down"](../08-spell-list.md#down) and ["Shape Earth"](../08-spell-list.md#shape-earth) to keep their to immobilise foes and flee to ["Warded Ground"](../08-spell-list.md#warded-ground). However when they must hold their ground, they will use ["Least Spike"](../08-spell-list.md#least-spike) as a weapon.

Water sprites are the least of the water elementals and take many shapes. Generally they mimic the first moving material object or entity they observe on the material realm, so while they often take the shapes of beasts, birds and humanoids, they occasionally take on somewhat inane forms.

These sprites inhabit aquifers and bodies of water, but they are most noticeable in streams, small rivers and the litoral zone, where they are more likely to encounter humanoids. While seldom hostile to mortals, they have a tendency to inadvertently drown them, which can make them quite dangerous.

Wind sprites are minor air elementals that like peaceful skies and hate lightning. They particularly like exploring topographically complex terrain and are often found near the ground. They are the ones responsible for laundry and hats blowing away and for the sudden rustling of leaves on days when one would not normally expect it.

Wind sprites hate lightning and vacate an area when they sense a storm brewing.

Ifrits are spirits associated with fire, wrath, rebellion and often malevolence. It is not unheard of them to challenge, harm, or attempt to tempt mortals, only to then punish them if they give in to temptation.

Ifrits exist in a highly hierarchical society of spirits. Lesser Ifrits obey the will of Greater Ifrits and Ifrit lords. Nevertheless, these rebellious spirits will not miss an opportunity to climb to a higher position than their superiors. This is often done through the consumption of tainted mortal souls.

An ifrit thrives on combat. However, before entering combat with a mortal it will generally attempt to lead its soul astray. Once the mortal shows itself as corruptable, the Ifrit has permission to attack. They seldom attack otherwise. It makes generous use of "Speak through Flame", "Illusory Self" and "Spelldance" in these matters.

In combat, Ifrits will use spells such as "Least Curse" to weaken a mortal. If their sins are judged to be particularly heavy, the Ifrit will attempt to burn up its target with its offensive capability.

Ifrits are spirits associated with fire, wrath, rebellion and often malevolence. It is not unheard of them to challenge, harm, or attempt to tempt mortals, only to then punish them if they give in to temptation.

Ifrits exist in a highly hierarchical society of spirits. Greater Ifrits stand near the top of this hierarchy and may command a number of lesser Ifrit. Likewise, they themselves must obey the will of Ifrit lords above them.

A greater Ifrit thrives on combat. However, before entering combat with a mortal it will generally attempt to lead its soul astray. Once the mortal shows itself as corruptable, the Ifrit has permission to attack. They seldom attack otherwise. It makes generous use of "Speak through Flame", "Illusory Self" and "Spelldance" in these matters.

In combat, Ifrits will use spells such as "Least Curse" or "Madness" to weaken a mortal. If their sins are judged to be particularly heavy, the Ifrit will attempt to burn up its target with its offensive capability.

## Spirits: Fey

Fey are spiritual beings associated in some way to the natural world. They tend to inhabit the membrane layers between the material and spirit world and travel readily, if not freely, between the two (although not freely). Fey spirits may be malicious of benevolent, but even if whimsical they are bound strictly by their own logic. Fey spirits have the following properties:

- Fey beings are immune to "physical" damage, as their physical form is either unnecessary or not "real". The immunity to physical damage does not apply to damage caused by weapons made of iron or steel.
- Fey beings are immune to "stunned", "immobilised", "crippled", "bleeding", "poisoned", "paralysed" as well as "aphonia" and "deafened".
- All fey have at least one ability that causes "frightened" or "charmed".
- Most fey have a "blink" speed.

___
### Faun (fey)

A faun, similar to a satyr, is a fey that takes the material form of a humanoid with a goat's horns and legs. Fauns, more often than not are generally benign, and unlike Satyrs, children of Bacchus, are not easily consumed by revelry. Instead they live out hidden lives in the wilderness. A faun's music is said to exude a strong fey magic and has the property of charming mortals.

### Changeling

Changelings are fey beings that make their way onto the mortal realm by way of exchange. That exchange is necessarily with a humanoid child whose place and form they take. A changeling lives out the humanoid's life for them, in humanoid form. When the lifespan of the humanoid they replaced expires, the changeling returns to the fey realm. Should the humanoid they displaced be returned by some means to the mortal realm the changeling is shunted back to the fey realm. Should the humanoid die, so does the changeling.

This stat block represents a doppelganger who has taken the form of a common human. NB: lower level doppelgangers can, in theory, exist. It should be noted that doppelgangers instinctively try to avoid showing their inhuman abilities in front of the humanoids they dwell with, least their cover is broken. If their cover is broken they will sooner kill or otherwise silence the witness than allow themselves to be discovered.

### Brownie

A brownie is a tiny spirit which associates itself with a humanoid dwelling. Brownies tend to be benevolent and bring blessings to the dwellings they inhabit. Should the dwelling be destroyed, the brownie must find a new dwelling before the full moon or perish.

### Dryad

Dryads are spirits of trees that take a material form. A dryad cannot move beyond the edge of the root system of its tree. For this reason, dryads associated with birches are particularly powerful. A dryad whose tree perishes likewise perishes. A dryad can abandon its tree and return to the spirit realm on the first day of winter without perishing. Should it do so, however, its tree perishes.

### Nymph/Naiad

Nymphs are similar to undines and are sometimes known as naiads. They are the spirits of natural streams and charm humanoids, sometimes involuntarily. They generally take the form of attractive female humanoids, but can also take the form of kingfishers and otters. Unlike other fey, however, they straddle the boundary between between "spirits" and "divinity", and as such, while generally benevolent, make for dangerous foes. A nymph cannot leave the catchment of its stream. Furthermore, should its stream dry up or be dammed for a full year, the nymph perishes. A nymph can leave its stream and pass to the spirit realm by travelling to its estuary. Should it do so, however, the stream dries up. Only the sacrifice of an undine can restore it.

### Hound (fey)

Fey hounds, occasionally called "ghost hounds", are dark spirits of the hunt that are completely loyal to the hunt masters of the wild hunt. These hounds rejoice in the chase and in tormenting their prey once they close in. It should be noted that whatever their origins, these spirits are much wilier and more dangerous than wolves or dogs. They are particularly dangerous because they seldom lose the scent. In other words as long as the hound has your scent, the wild hunt will find you. And the hound will not lose its scent.

### Hunter (fey)

The wild hunt is a phenomenon wherein fey associated with the more predatory side of nature gather under a huntsmaster, and following a ritual declares the prey for this hunt. The hunt will then continue until the prey is caught and sacrificed to the spirits of the primeval wild. While any being may become a hunter, most hunters are wild fey spirits devoted to the hunt. Each hunter generally drives half a dozen hounds. Sometimes hunters compete amongst each other, sometimes they cooperate to bring down the most dangerous of prey.

### Huntsmaster (fey)

The wild hunt is a phenomenon wherein fey associated with the more predatory side of nature gather under a huntsmaster, and following a ritual declares the prey for this hunt. The huntsmaster is usually a minor fey lord, or at the very least an ancient fey. The huntsmaster leads the hunt in a ceremonial manner and serves to protect the hunt, be it to protect individual hunters, or to protect the hunt from hunters who have strayed from the strange code of ethics that governs the hunt, or from other beings that would seek to impede the hunt. Huntsmasters are an opponent seldom encountered, and an encounter seldom survived.

### True Fairy

At first glance easily mistaken for grigs, pixies or brownies, fairies are the epitome of what it is to be fey and are the materialisation the boundary of the natural and spirit world. Fairies often appear as tiny humanoids with insectoid wings. Fairies can communicate with all mortals and spirits. Fairies possess absurdly powerful magic, but often naive and gullible. For this reason tragedies involving fairies are not uncommon. When a fairy is deceived and killed, it may become a [Demon](profanes.md#demon-fire-or-ice) if an oak or lilly is not planted at the site of its demise before the next full moon. If a fairy is broken by torment or torture, it becomes a glitch of half of its original level.
