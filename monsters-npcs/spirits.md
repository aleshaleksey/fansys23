## Spirits: Elementals

Elementals are spirits of the four elements. They are generally immune to physical damage (with the exception of some low level elementals) since the physical form they accrue is in no way necessary for their existence. Likewise they are immune to "stunned", "immobilised", "crippled", "bleeding", poisoned" and "paralysed".

Flame Sprites are the most dangerous of minor elementals. They are playful material spirits associated with fire an consisting of it. Despite their playfulness, their propensity to ignite everything they and step on as they dance, makes them extremely dangerous, even when they do not have hostile intent.

Gnomes are minor earth spirits that manifest as tiny humanoids made of dirt. In small numbers they can be either a boon or hindrance, and seldom cause problems bigger than potholes. Large numbers of angry gnomes have been known to cause landslides.

Gnomes tend to be reclusive and benign. On the other hand they tend to be curious and hospitable to mortals they take a liking to.

Water sprites are the least of the water elementals and take many shapes. Generally they mimic the first moving material object or entity they observe on the material realm, so while they often take the shapes of beasts, birds and humanoids, they occasionally take on somewhat inane forms.

These sprites inhabit aquifers and bodies of water, but they are most noticeable in streams, small rivers and the litoral zone, where they are more likely to encounter humanoids. While seldom hostile to mortals, they have a tendency to inadvertently drown them, which can make them quite dangerous.

Wind sprites are minor air elementals that like peaceful skies and hate lightning. They particularly like exploring topographically complex terrain and are often found near the ground. They are the ones responsible for laundry and hats blowing away and for the sudden rustling of leaves on days when one would not normally expect it.

Wind sprites hate lightning and vacate an area when they sense a storm brewing.
