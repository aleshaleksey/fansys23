|Proficiencies|||Any two tools or kits|
|Skills|-|-|Usually +2 to tinker, appraise or fortify and +1 to insight or a knowledge|
|Loot|||Usually 1-4sp and the clothes on their back|

The human commoner block represents the average civilian townfolk found in urban environments, as well as peasants and slaves whose roles in society do not involve much hard labour.

These humans seldom own weapon or armour, although some are proficient in a single weapon group.

These humans generally prefer to get on with their lives and avoid trouble, but often lack the knowledge of what that trouble looks like. They will usually sooner surrender and beg for their lives than fight overwhelming foes. No one wants to die.

### Human Peasant
|HiT|MP|SP|HP|Speed (walk)|Speed (other)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|10|6|13|3|30ft|-|

||Str|Dex|Con|Int|Wis|Cha|

|-|-|-|-|
|Club|+3|1d4+1 bludgeoning|-|
|Hand axe|+3|1d6+1 slashing|Proficient with any one weapon group, but no armour|
|Proficiencies|||Any two tools or kits|
|Skills|-|-|Usually +3 fortify, +2 to harvest, +1 to any one from the "sense" group|
|Loot|||Usually the tools of their trade, and clothes on their back.|

This represents any human that works in hard manual labour as well as frontier-dwellers such as farmers, trackers and bandits.

These humans are often proficient in any two weapon groups, though seldom own battlefield weapons, preferring a trusty axe, staff or hunter's bow.

Beware the humble human farmer working his field! He has had a tough life and survived. A peasant will not rush into combat, but will often be more than willing to defend his pride, home and kin. Still they would rather not have to. No one wants to die.

___
### Human Elite
|HiT|MP|SP|HP|Speed (walk)|Speed (other)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|11|21|23|30|-|

On the battlefield, will often use Cuirass and shield for (HiT: 17/16/11)

|||||
|Skills|||Has a +5 in deception, +5 in academics and 2 knowledge, +3 in persuade and sense motive|

These are well fed humans who are trained from birth to rule over their societies. They seldom fight, but often send others to fight for them. They will generally surrender once they have ran out of men to throw at their foe, or even before then. No one wants to die.

Elites seldom carry weapons or wear armour beyond a symbolic dagger or smallsword. Although if forced onto the battlefield will take up arms.
____
### Human Militia
|HiT/Surprised/Touch|MP|SP|HP|Speed (walk)|Speed (other)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|15/12/13|8|20|5|30ft|-|

The HiT includes +2 from padded armour and +2 from a small shield.

|Crossbow|+4|1d10+1 piercing|-|
|Proficiencies|||Two melee, one ranged, shield, medium armour|
|Skills|-|-|Usually +5 Athletics, +3 climb, fortify, +2 to any two from the "sense" group|

Militia block can be used for town guard or town militia, although frontier hunters and bandits also use this block. Ordinary soldiers, such as hoplites, levied for a campaign should use this stat block.

A militiaman seldom carries more than one or two of the weapons listed. A town guard patrolling the streets might carry a mace, while one patrolling the road for monsters might carry a spear. The frontier hunter might carry a shortbow and dagger, while a gate guard might sport a crossbow.

Militiamen will normally perform their combat duty, but will break and flee if the odds are overwhelming. No one wants to die.

### Human Warrior
|HiT/Surprised/Touch|MP|SP|HP|Speed (walk)|Speed (other)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|17/14/13|17|49|10|30|-|

|Counterstrike|||All melee attacks provoke attacks of opportunity|

|Skills|||+7 "athletics", +5 "fortify" and "climb". +3 "swim", +4 to "observe" and "sense motive".|
|Loot|||All his stuff and 10-400sp|

This represents a seasoned veteran of many campaigns who devotes his life to war. Still if he sees himself hopelessly outmatched by one who is not his sworn hope, he will surrender. No one wants to die.

This block can also represents guard captains, monster hunters and other humans who have devoted their lives to violence.

A warrior usually carries one heavy weapon weapon and a sidearm. He may also carry a ranged weapon. He usually has an attendant, or at least a pack animal.

### Human Knight

|Skills|||Athletics +11, Ride 9, Acrobatics +5, Climb +7, Creature Handling +8, Sense Motive +4, Observe +4, History +3|

A knight is an elite warrior, trained from birth to fight and rule. This block can also represent generals and kings who lived their life on the battlefield.

A knight usually has a warhorse, squire and attendants. Like a warrior, he will carry a main weapon and shield into battle and carry a side arm. Knights seldom carry ranged weapons, trusting their heavy armour to protect and squire (stat as [militiaman](#human-militia)) to back them up.


## Elf

### Elvish Youth
|HiT/Surprised/Touch|MP|SP|HP|Speed (walk)|Speed (other)|

|Skills|-|-|Usually +3 to "perform", +1 to one knowledge, +2 to "acrobatics" or +1 to "stealth"|
|Loot|||Usually some small trinket of sentimental value and the clothes on their back|

Elves live for a ridiculously long time. This stat block represents an elf that has lived for 100 years or less.

An ordinary elf will seldom carry weapons beyond a dagger for no reason. These elves will seldom try to start a fight, preferring to hide and observe. If threatened they prefer to accept the terms and obtain revenge later if there is any risk. No one wants to die.

The average elf has lived for centuries and has had time to learn an incredible range of skills. This thus represents your average elf.

An average elf will carry a sling and knife for self defense, knowing that the world is more dangerous than it appears. They seldom enter combat unless there is a strict necessity for it. No one wants to die.

This represents a millennia old elf. They have likely seen civilisations rise and fall. If they ever had friends amongst shorter lived mortals, then they have likely passed on long ago. This entity has a terrifying wealth of experience. This block can represent an elvish king, or some traveller who has wondered the earth for longer than he can remember. Either way, this is an extremely dangerous opponent.

Elvish elders seldom carry much on their journeys. They will almost never engage in combat (how else does one live this long). However, should an inevitable threat appear, they will attempt to eradicate it in the most effective manner. They will not fight fair or put themselves in danger unless absolutely necessary. No one wants to die.

This block represents an elite warrior/scout who hunts down evil creatures and enemies of elven-kind, be they monsters that hunt people, or people who hunt elves.

A hunter carries only what they need to exist autonomously and hunt down their pray. A hunter prefers to remain hidden and kill from afar, if necessary using magic to deceive, mislead and otherwise gain the upper hand. A hunter makes maximum use of "sniper" and "aphonic spell" to avoid detection. They will use "silence" to shut down enemy spellcasters. Killing prey when it sleeps or is otherwise weak is most preferable. However, if they must they will fight up close using their superior speed to inflict a death by a thousand cuts.

**NB**: Do not use this stat block unless you intend to kill the party, or know that they have a very good capacity when it comes to detecting hidden foes.
