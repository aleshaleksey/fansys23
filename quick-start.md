# FanSys23

This is a fantasy roleplaying system optimised for balance that uses 2d12 for its core roll. It is meant for games with a focus on small group combat and exploration, with an emphasis on the balance between mundane and supernatural, and inhuman characters.

## Playing the game

The game is played like any of the number of table top roleplaying games that exist. This game uses a similar concept to Pathfinder or Dungeons and Dragons, with the big difference that it uses 2d12 instead of 1d20 as the dice roll that decides the outcome of uncertain events and interactions.
