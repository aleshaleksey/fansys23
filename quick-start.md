# FanSys23

This is a fantasy roleplaying system optimised for balance that uses 2d12 for its core roll. It is meant for games with a focus on small group combat and exploration, with an emphasis on the balance between mundane and supernatural, and inhuman characters.

## Playing the game

The game is played like any of the number of table top roleplaying games that exist. This game uses a similar concept to Pathfinder or Dungeons and Dragons, with the big difference that it uses 2d12 instead of 1d20 as the dice roll that decides the outcome of uncertain events and interactions (See "[Base Rules: Rolling Dice](base-rules.md#rolling-dice)" for more detail). To play this game, one needs to:

1. Find a group.
2. Assign a DM.
3. Decide on a power level, game style, etc.
4. Make characters.
5. Play.

Below the rules for making a character is briefly described.

## Making a character

1. Decide on a concept or build. What kind of person/creature do you wish your character to be? What kind of things do you want them to be good at?
2. Assign stats.
3. Apply race/template.
4. Assign skill points and background skill.
5. Assign stamina and mana dice and calculate HP.
6. Assign alignment (optional).
7. Assign abilities.
8. If starting above level 1, repeat (4) and (5) for each level until done.
9. Play!

### Character concepts

FanSys is a class-free system which supports different races and templates. So depending on what setting, power level, and game style the group has chosen, a character can be a human mage, or a cat girl sword master, or a winged beast that breathes fire, or a vampire.

Likewise it is worth thinking about *who* your character is. Are they an ambitious peasant going out into the world to find their chosen one? Are they a weary old knight who has gone on one last quest? Or did they perhaps just misread a map on the way to town and ended up in this god forsaken wilderness with an overambitious peasant and a weary old knight?

___
### Stats

There are six stats. Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis and Cha. Each one represents how intrinsically "strong" some aspect of the character is.

1. **Str**: Physical strength. Upstream of most weapon attack, damage. Upstream of abilities linked to affecting the surroundings by physical force.
2. **Dex**: Physical agility. Upstream to some weapon attack, damage (usually ranged). Upstream to evasive abilities. Upstream to abilities linked to affecting the surroundings by delicate manipulation.
3. **Con**: Physical resilience. Upstream of HP, SP, aspects of physical interactions
4. **Int**: Mental agility. Ability to memorise, deduce, analyse, IQ. Upstream to skill points, some aspects of supernatural abilities.
5. **Wis**: Faculty of judgement, discernment, sense, EQ. Upstream of supernatural abilities, abilities devoted to detection, some aspects of social interactions.
6. **Cha**: Force of Personality, pluck, mental resilience. Upstream of HP, MP, aspects of social interactions.

Each stat also has a save of the same name. These protect you from certain indirect and insidious effects. They are used by rolling 2d12 plus the save bonus against a threshold. 

Assign your stats using one of these two systems.

#### Random roll 4d6 drop lowest

1. Roll 4d6, count the total of the highest 3 dice (4d6dl1).
2. These 6 totals, in any order are your character's stats.
3. Apply racial/template modifiers.
4. If any stat is below 5, raise it to 5.

#### 24 point point buy

1. Start with a blank sheet and 24 points.
2. Assign points in accordance with the cost table until all 6 stats are assigned and the remaining points are 0. If you end with unassigned points, those points are lost.

The point cost for point buy is as follows:

|Value|Bonus|Total Cost|
|-|-|-|
|8|-1|-2|
|9|-1|-1|
|10|0|0|
|11|0|1|
|12|+1|2|
|13|+1|3|
|14|+2|4|
|15|+2|6|
|16|+3|8|
|17|+3|11|
|18|+4|14|

But which stats are important? Simply put:
- If you want your character to be plucky and tough, pump Cha and Con.
- Cha also helps with mental resilience, which Con helps with physical stamina.
- If you want your character to be agile and precise, pump Dex.
- If you want them to be athletic and strong, pump Str.
- If you want your character to be smart and wiley, pump Int or Wis.

Beware there are stats and stat bonuses. Bonuses are added to rolls, stats are just "there". When we speak about stat bonuses we write eg [Str]. When we talk about a stat we write eg Str.

For more information on stats see "[Base Rules: Stats](base-rules.md#stats)".

# Types, Races, Species and Templates

Some roleplaying fantasy species support different playable races (eg humans, elves, dwarves, etc) and some do not. Systems like DnD and Pathfinder have "baked in" races. Other systems like "Ryuutama" allow only humans. This system supports races from different creature types, as this can add an enormous amount of flavour to a game, and a good amount of mechanical complexity, but does not consider them a necessary core rule, as this is considered to be setting specific.

## Races and Species

The system does not debate whether different races are different species or not. This is a setting specific decision.

## Templates

All characters start with a template. A template is a set of abilities, traits and properties. Usually it is associated with a race or creature type. Not all templates are equal. Some templates (eg dragon, angel) are blatantly more powerful than others. In order to offset this, templates have levels. Templates exist for level 0, level 4 and level 9. They can also be created for other levels. For a start, level 0 templates should be considered the standard.

For higher power games, where players wish to play angels, devils, dragons and other things, higher level templates should be used. It is recommended that all players use templates of the same level, as low level templates with extra class levels mix poorly with higher level templates.

___
### Race or template

It is possible that the setting has only humans. This is fine. For some. Others prefer a world with many different kinds of sapient beings that they can play. It might be a world with timeless elves and  brutish orcs. Or it might be a world with beasts that roam the land, sea people who inhabit the waters and winged folk whose domain is the sky.

In either case, the unique characteristics of these beings are represented by "templates" or "races". 

Depending on the power level of the game one can pick a basic race or a "level-4" or "level-9" template. It is is essential that it is pre-agreed beforehand what level template everyone picks. I guarantee that unless the group is extremely chilled you will fall out if you do not. Advanced templates, as well as rules on how to make new ones are found in the "[Races](races.md)" chapter. When introducing new templates or races to a setting make sure to discuss your ideas with the rest of the agree.

#### How to apply a race/template

Templates generally give some small bonuses, a few nice features, some of which cannot be gained by other means. Some also give your character penalties. These can be both a pain and a roleplaying crutch. To apply a template:

1. Read over the template.
2. Apply the creature size to your character, adjust heights and weights within 20% as desired.
3. Apply stat bonuses and penalties.
4. Apply [size modifiers](base-rules.md#size-rules).
5. Apply movement speed, special senses and type.
6. Add proficiencies and skill bonuses.
7. Add special abilities, resistances and vulnerabilities.

___
### A few basic templates

I am not sure which ones exist in your setting, but I quite like these ones.

___
#### Human (level-0 template)

Human represents the human race. The human race is the base. Humans have no special senses, resistances, movement modalities or spooky abilities. To compensate this, they adapt quickly to new environments, and begin learning the skills needed to survive in their homeland as soon as they are old enough to walk. Humans have a lifespan that does not exceed a century, reach a breeding age in their teens and can produce up to two dozen offspring in their lifetime.
- **Size**: Medium (Height: ~5'8", Weight: ~140lb)
- **Stats**: (Str: 0, Dex: 0, Con: 0, Int: 0, Wis: 0, Cha: 0)
- **Movement**: Walk 30ft
- **Sight**: Normal
- **Type**: Humanoid (needs to breathe, drink, eat, and sleep). Humans age.
- **Proficiencies**: Common Language.

Extra:
- A +2 bonus to any stat, and +1 to two other stats.
- +2 to any one skill. 
- Any 2 proficiencies.

Race boon (level 8 and 16):
- +2 bonus to any stat.
- 4 skill points to spend on skills and proficiencies.

___
#### Elf/(Fey touched) (level-0 template)

This is a race that is closer to the fey, either created when fey spirits took material form in exchange for something, or when they mingled with humankind, or bestowed their "gifts" upon humans long ago. Elves/Fey touched live ridiculously long lives. Compared to humans they have slender, wiry bodies and longer ears. They are known as sometimes known as the "fair folk" and see well in twilight hours.
- **Size**: Medium (Height: ~5'8", Weight: ~115lb)
- **Stats**: (Str: 0, Dex: +2, Con: -2, Int: 0, Wis: 0, Cha: +1)

- **Proficiencies**: Common, Elvish tongues. Bows OR one class of instrument.

Extra:
- +2 Observe
- Resistance to "Charmed"

Race boon (level 8 and 16):
- Immunity to one of "Charmed", "Blinded", "Stunned" or "Bleeding".
- +5 to walking speed

___
#### Orc (level-0 template)

This is a race that is closer to the feral side of humanoids. They are stronger and sturdier than humans, are apt hunters, but tend to lack aptitude for the academic. Orcs lead shorter lives than humans and reproduce even faster.

- Resistance to bludgeoning and advantage on saves vs "Prone".

Race boon (level 8 and 16):
- Resistance to one of "piercing", "slashing" or "pressure" or "shear".
- +1 Con, +1 Str.

___
#### The Winged (level-0 template)

This is a race of winged humanoids that live in high and isolated places, as well as loci associated with elemental air. They are small of stature, sharp sighted, and often shy of other races.
- **Size**: Medium (Height: ~3'3", Weight: ~32lb, Wingspan: ~11ft.)
- **Stats**: (Str: -2, Dex: +2, Con: 0, Int: 0, Wis: 0, Cha: 0)

Race boon (level 8 and 16):
- +5 to movement speed.
- +2 to one of "Str", "Dex", "Con" or "Wis"
- 1 level of incantation magic.

___
### Skills and abilities

At level one a character starts with the following:

+ 6 + [Int] skill points (these can also be used for weapon, armour, language and tool proficiencies)
+ 1 background skill
+ 3 level points
+ 1 save in which they are proficient
+ 1 homeland
+ 3 dice points (NB: these are neither skills nor abilities...)

#### Skills and proficiencies

Skills and proficiencies determine how well practiced your character is with certain routine or esoteric arts, skills or sciences, as well as which tools, weapons and armours they know how to use. A character essentially starts with between 5 and 11 skill points. It is recommended that you take at least one weapon proficiency and one armour proficiency, and maybe more for martial characters. For more information see the "[Skills](skills.md)" and "[Weapons and Armour](weapons-armour.md)" chapters.

Secondly, a character starts with one background skill, where they get to add a small bonus called "Base" (+1 at level 1).

Thirdly, a character also gets to choose a home terrain. This can be anything from "town" or "plains" to "ruins" or "subterranean". The character has a +5 bonus to navigation and camping in that terrain (very useful).

Fourthly, a character chooses a save with which they are proficient. This will help defend them against some nasty stuff, so choose carefully.

Lastly, a character gains 3 level points. Level points are spent on gaining abilities. These range from extra save proficiencies, to sword arts and spell casting, and much more. A level point can also be exchanged for 3 skill points or a +1 increase to any stat (although no stat can exceed 24 for a character). For a list of abilities see the "[Abilities](abilities.md)" chapter.

___
### Stamina and Mana dice and HP

HP represents a character's vitality, physical body or life force. Importantly, losing HP represents taking actual damage and often has consequences, such as losing limbs, bleeding and death. A character loses HP by taking damage from attacks and indirect effects (like a fireball or an avalanche). Try not to lose too much HP too often.

A character's HP is equal to [Level + [Con] + [Cha]]. So for a level one character with +3 [Con] and +1 [Cha], the HP total is 5. This is not a lot. If at the end of the calculation you start off with 0 HP, then your HP total is set to 1.

Luckily a character also has mana (or mental) points (MP) and stamina points (SP). When a character is hit with a mundane ("natural") attack, the damage is first subtracted from SP, and only if it is massive damage, or if the character runs out of SP, does the damage actually affect HP. This works in the same way of MP and supernatural attacks. SP and MP are different from HP in three ways.

1. You do not die if you run out of SP or MP. You do lose the ability to use your more powerful abilities though.
2. You regain SP and MP a lot faster than HP, and taking damage to SP/MP represents using your combat/magical prowess to shrug off damage at the expense of expending your energy.
3. SP and MP are used to fuel various powerful abilities. So they are both offensive and defensive. HP just sits there and looks pretty.

The amount of SP or MP a character has is determined by how many SP dice and MP dice it has. A level one character starts with 1 SP dice and 1 MP and 3 dice points to assign as they wish for additional SP or MP dice.

The total MP = [Level x [Cha] + 2 x [MP dice]]
The total SP = [Level x [Con] + 2 x [SP dice]]

So if a character starts with 3 SP dice and 2 MP dice, and has +3 [Con] and +1 [Cha] then,

+ MP = [1 x 1 + 2 x 2] = 5
+ SP = [3 x 1 + 2 x 3] = 9

This is also not a lot, but already a lot better than it used to be!

___
### A word on HiT, NAP, SAP and other 3 letter words.

This introduction leaves a lot of unanswered questions, such as "how do I attack?", "saves defend against indirect attacks, but what about direct attacks?", "why am I even playing this?" and probably quite a few more. Before looking for answers in other chapters, we present a brief answer to the first two.

#### HiT

HiT (Hit Threshold) represents how difficult it is to harm a character with targeted attacks. An attack roll must meet or beat HiT to do damage. In most cases HiT is calculated as [10 + Evasion + Armour + Shield + Deflection].

+ Armour and Shield bonus is determined by the armour and shield that is equipped, usually.
+ Evasion is generally equal to [Dex] + [Size modifier]
+ Deflection is granted by blades which can be used to parry, and certain abilities.

In general, the higher the hit the better (See "[Base Rules: Hit Threshold (HiT)](base-rules.md#hit-threshold-(hit)"). A level one character can expect to have HiT 16 when kitted up.

___
#### Attack bonuses and thresholds

Attacks must overcome HiT to do damage, abilities are opposed by a save. "Natural" attacks are governed by Str and Dex (use [Str] or [Dex] bonus to hit), while "supernatural" attacks are governed by Int and Wis (use [Int] or [Wis] bonus to hit, usually [Wis]).

The Attack Potential of a character's ability is determined by the total number of SP dice it has divided by 6 (for "natural" attacks) or the total number of MP dice it has divided by 6 (for "supernatural" attacks). These bonuses are called the "Nat" and "Sup" respectively, and are used a lot! Overall the total attack bonus is generally given by:

+ For "natural" abilities, attack potential (NAP) = [Nat] + [Base]
+ For "supernatural" abilities, attack potential (SAP) = [Sup] + [Base]

So for our example level one character who had 3 SP dice and 2 MP dice:

+ [Nat] = [SP dice] / 6 = 3 / 6 = 1 (because we always round these things up)
+ [Sup] = [MP dice] / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1 (because we always round up)

With the above [Nat] and [Sup] values (1), at level one (when [Base] = 1), our example character will have both [NAP] and [SAP] equal to 2. 

Now if the character has +2 [Str] and 0 [Int], for Str based attacks, such as cutting with an axe, it will have a bonus of 2 + 2 = 4. On the other hand for Int based attacks, such as casting an incantation, it will be 2 + 0 = 2. Clearly this character is better off using an axe!

In short:
- Str based attack bonus = [SP dice total] / 6 + [Base] + [Str]
    - = [Nat] + [Base] + [Str]
        - = [NAP] + [Str]

Luckily we don't have to calculate the attack potentials outside of leveling up our characters. And even then we can just use the tables in the "[Base Rules: Tables](base-rules.md#tables)".

___
### Alignment

This is OPTIONAL.

Some systems have an alignment system, usually along the order/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. There is no such system here. Rather we fully embrace orange/blue morality.

A character does not have to be aligned with or to anything. Not even magnetic north. A character CAN, however, be "aligned" with various types of forces if they chose. This is not necessarily guided by behaviour or moral code of a character. It is however important for certain abilities and may influence how certain entities perceive the character.

Alignments can be: "None", "Spiritual", "Divine" and "Profane".

+ None: The normal state of being for a mortal.
+ Spiritual: Implies priority of the immaterial world over the material world.
+ Divine: Implies homage to the forces that created and maintain the world.
+ Profane: Implies homage to the forces that oppose creation.
+ One cannot be aligned to "Divine" and "Profane" simultaneously as those forces oppose each other.
+ A character can also become aligned with various elements. This affects how other elements interact with the character.

___
### Level points and abilities

Every character gets 3 level points at level 1. These can be spend as follows.

+ Exchanged for skill points at the rate of 1 level points = 3 skill points.
+ Exchanged for an increase to stats at the rate of 1 level point = +1 to a single stat. No stat may exceed 24 for player characters. A character can only add one level point to stats per level.
+ Exchanged for abilities and boons.

Abilities and boons are special features of a character that allow them to do things they would not otherwise be able to do, or withstand things they would otherwise not be able to withstand. This also provides some of the flavour to the character. As an example:

- An aspiring pyromancer would probably want to take "[elemental touch](abilities.md#elemental-touch)" or "[elemental blast](abilities.md#elemental-blast)" and "[spellcasting: elemental (fire)](abilities.md#spellcasting-elemental)".
- A plucky peasant or mysterious summoner might both wish to travel with a bestial companion and so take "[bind beast](abilities.md#bind-beast-i-x)".
- Swashbuckler and martial artists would probably both benefit from "[flurry](abilities.md#flurry)".

___
### Leveling up

Leveling up, strangely enough, is quite easy, if not for the agony of choice. Each time a character levels up it gains:

+ 1 HP
+ 3 dice points to share between gaining SP dice and MP dice.
+ [3 + Int] skill points to put into skill ranks and proficiencies. 
+ 1 skill to add to background skills
+ 3 level points, to be used for abilities, or exchanged for skill points (3 skill points per level point).

A character must spend all points when it levels up. It cannot horde unspent points waiting for the next level.

___
### Play

Go get kitted out, and go out into the world and become a legend. Or if you prefer not to, then just roll some dice. There are a lot of different situations that a party can encounter in this game. And of course there are rules that govern how to resolve them. They are covered in "[Weapons and Armour](weapons-armour.md)", "[Combat](combat.md)" "[Movement and Exploration](movement-exploration.md)", "[Skills](skills.md)" and "[Conditions and Types](conditions-types.md)". Live and learn.
