# Types, Races, Species and Templates

Some roleplaying fantasy species support different playable races (eg humans, elves, dwarves, etc) and some do not. Systems like DnD and Pathfinder have "baked in" races. Other systems like "Ryuutama" allow only humans. This system supports races from different creature types, as this can add an enormous amount of flavour to a game, and a good amount of mechanical complexity, but does not consider them a necessary core rule, as this is considered to be setting specific.

## Races and Species

The system does not debate whether different races are different species or not. This is a setting specific decision.

## Templates

All characters start with a template. A template is a set of abilities, traits and properties. Usually it is associated with a race or creature type. Not all templates are equal. Some templates (eg dragon, angel) are blatantly more powerful than others. In order to offset this, templates have levels. Templates exist for level 0, level 4 and level 9. They can also be created for other levels.

For higher power games, where players wish to play angels, devils, dragons and other things, higher level templates should be used. It is recommended that all players use higher level templates, as low level templates with extra class levels mix poorly with higher level templates.

### Basic template rules

- Templates are applied after stats are assigned at character creation.
- Templates/races of different level should NOT be used in the same game.
- A template can also be applied later on if something special happens to a character, however, this must come at the cost of class levels, unless the group forsakes balance.
- All characters in a game should have the same total level (template + character levels).
- The HP of a character is determined by the combined template + character levels.
- The SP dice, MP dice pools, level points and skill points are determined by character level alone. Although a template may grant additional points (though this is not what it is for!).

### The base character without templates

A level 1 character, before being build, has:
- **Size**: Medium
- **Stats**: All stats set to 10
- **Movement**: A walking speed of 30ft and no other movement modalities
- **Senses**:  Hearing, Sight, Smell, Taste, and Touch.
- **Sight**: Sight in bright light and disadvantage in dim light (aka, no dark-vision or low-light vision)
- **Limbs**: Two prehensile limbs.
- **Type**: Humanoid (needs to breathe, drink, eat, and sleep).
- **Proficiencies**: All characters are proficient with one language.

### The base template

The base template allows the following:

**Stat changes**: Add +2 or +1 to any number of stats (total 11 or 12), for a total of no more than +4, as long as -1 or -2 is subtracted from any number of stats (total 8 or 9) in such a way that the total added is zero (total of all stats = 60, no stat higher than 12, no stat lower than 8).

**Size change:** Change size to small or large. This comes with advantages and disadvantage.

**Template points**: A template gains **4 template points**. Template points may be spent in a packet, or one by one.

One template point can gain:

- Resistance to a C or B Class damage type and one associated (B or C Class) condition.
  - A template may grant only 1 damage resistance or immunity per template level.
- Advantage on saves vs two B or C class conditions.
  - A template may grant only 2 condition resistances or immunities per template level.
- A permanent +2 bonus to a single skill, OR 2 proficiencies.
  - The template bonus to skills NEVER stack.
- A 30ft climb speed or a 40ft swim speed.
- A permanent +2 to a single stat, or +1 to two separate stats.
  - A template may only grant +2 to the same stat ONCE per template level. 
- Speed increase to climb, walk, or swim speed by 5ft. Increase fly speed by 10ft. Increase cosmic speed by 20ft.
- A passive or active (C class) ability with no prerequisites (eg water breathing).
- Remove a necessity (age, sleep).

Two template points can gain:
- Resistance to an A or S class damage type and one associated (B or C Class) condition.
  - A template may grant only 1 damage resistance or immunity per template level.
- Advantage on saves vs one A or S class conditions.
  - A template may grant only 2 condition resistances or immunities per template level.
- Immunity to a single B or C Class condition.
  - A template may grant only 2 condition resistances or immunities per template level.
- A passive or active (B class) ability with no prerequisites.
- A 5ft dig speed or a 60ft (average) fly speed. Characters that pick this option have a -10ft speed penalty to their climb, walk and swim speeds.
- Improve fly speed by a level (average -> good, good -> perfect).
- A passive or active (B class) ability with no prerequisites.
- Remove a necessity (drink or eat).

Three template points can gain:
- Immunity to an A class damage type and one associated condition.
  - A template may grant only 1 damage resistance or immunity per template level.
- Immunity to a single A or S Class condition (this does more harm than good sometimes).
  - A template may grant only 2 condition resistances or immunities per template level.
- A passive or active (A class) ability with no prerequisites.
- A blink speed (30ft).
  - Template must be at least level 2 to have a blink speed.
- A cosmic speed (100ft).
  - A template must be at least level 5 to have a cosmic speed.
- A passive or active (A class) ability with no prerequisites.
- Remove a necessity (breathe).

In addition you can gain an extra point for each:
- Vulnerability.
- Special Restriction (eg. Cannot cross flowing water).
