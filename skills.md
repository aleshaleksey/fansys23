## Skills and Proficiencies

The game has **skills** and **proficiencies**. The game defines them as follows. They do not necessarily reflect "real life" accurately since this is both a game and an abstraction.

- **Skills:** are general abilities that cover a range of activities that a character can learn and improve in with time. For example, **swimming** is a skill because it covers, swimming, diving and similar, and a character's ability to swim is graded. Eg. "I can't swim", "I can swim but not well", "I can cross a river, yeah", "I've swam 20 miles, it took me 3 hours".
- **Proficiencies:** A proficiency is the knowledge and ability in using a very specific set of tools or abilities. Having a **proficiency** allows a character to use a skill with the tool/ability with a skill. Eg. Proficiency in **lock picks** with a **tinker** check allows picking locks. Proficiency with **whale** allows you to use **diplomacy** skill to persuade whales when speaking in their language.

### Acquiring skills and proficiencies

Skills are usually acquired at level up by either assigning skill points or adding a skill to "background skills". This reflects time spent honing skills through use on adventure and picking up new skills and techniques by training. Certain special abilities also grant additional skills and proficiencies.

It is NOT advisable to allow a character to gain additional skill points outside of this unless it is necessary for party balance or plot reasons. Even then it should not be taken lightly. As an optional rule, a character may spend a solid month of training to gain 1 skill point. Even so, the total number of points (ranks) in a skill cannot exceed [LVL]/2. Certain supernatural abilities can also transfer a skill from one entity to another, but no entity should use them lightly.

### Skill points (ranks)

A character gets skill points (ranks) based on level and intelligence. The maximum number of points (ranks) in one skill is as follows:

- **[LEVEL / 2] rounded up**.

Every level a character gains skill points equal to **3 + [INT]**. So at level LVL a character has **[LVL] x (3 + [INT])** skill points (not counting any ranks gained through converting "level points" to skill points).

A skill point can be assigned to either (a) gain a proficiency, or (b) add a rank to a skill. Each level a character can reassign one of the previously assigned skill points to a different proficiency or skill. If a character has **zero** ranks in a skill, any roll of the dice (before modifiers!) in that skill above 12 counts as 12. This reflects lack of specialist knowledge and experience that that character lacks.

### Base and "background" bonus

Every level a character adds a "background" skill to add its **base** to. This cannot be reassigned later. At level N a character has N skills which are assigned as background skills (eg: 3 at level 3). This reflects knowledge in untrained skills that a character has picked up over their adventures, travels and other lifetime experience without actual training.

### Total Skill bonus

A character has a skill bonus of **[Base (optional)] + [ranks] + [ability bonus]**. So a character with INT = +2, and 2 ranks in "swim" has a +4 to swim. If they have assigned "swim" as a background skill, and their base is +1, the total bonus is +5.

### Circumstance bonus

Sometimes circumstances may add a +2/+5 to a roll (eg Homeland bonus for navigation). Sometimes they may cause advantage or disadvantage. Sometimes they are codified in the rules, sometimes the DM may apply them as appropriate.

### Skill groups

Some skills are similar to each other as to be somewhat transferable. In this case the character may roll a different skill from the same group with a -5 penalty. The groups are:

#### Language Proficiencies

There are as many language proficiencies as there are languages in your setting. In order to speak, understand, read and write a language a character must be proficient in it.

Optionally, for gritty settings language proficiency does not grant a character the ability to read and write, and they must have a rank in "academics" in order to read or write. This, however, makes "academics" very strong.

#### Tool Proficiencies

Using tools usually requires a roll of an associated skill. Some skills cannot be used for certain purposes unless the character is also proficient with appropriate tools. At the group's discretion it can makes sense for other skills may be associated with a tool (eg woodworking tools being used with **fortify** for making big items like wooden walls). Tools and their properties are further discussed below (in the "[Tools](#Kit%20and%20Tool%20Descriptions)" sections).

- Athletics group based:
  - Diver's tools

- Perform
  - Disguise kit
  - Gaming Set (pick by group or individually)
  - Musical Instrument (pick by group or individually)

#### Armour Proficiencies

Any entity whose body fits a suit of armour can wear the armour. As such it will get the normal benefit to the hit threshold.

- When an entity dons or doffs an armour it is not proficient with, it takes twice as long to don and doff the armour as normal.
- While an entity is wearing an armour it is not proficient with it takes a -5 penalty to all [DEX] and [STR] based rolls it makes.

Armour and its properties are further discussed in the "[Weapons and Armour Section](weapons-armour.md)".

There are three armour proficiencies that each cover several groups of armour.

- Light armours
  - Full Padded
  - Leather Cuirass
  - Chain Shirt
- Medium armours
  - Full Leather
  - Hide armour
  - Metal Cuirass
  - Any Paper Armour
- Heavy Armour
  - Full Chain
  - Full Splint
  - Full Chain
  - Half Plate
  - Full Plate
  - Any Adamantine Armour
- Shields (all)

#### Weapon Proficiencies

Weapons are tools that increase an entity's lethality in combat. For the sake of this definition, this does not include martial or supernatural abilities. Weapons and their properties are further discussed in the "Weapons and Armour Section".

Any entity may wield a weapon it is physically capably of wielding. If it is not proficient, it makes attacks with a -5 penalty. On a critical fail it damages itself, rolling the same damage dice it would as if it had hit the intended target. In addition it provokes attacks of opportunity when it attacks, since poor technique leaves openings.

Proficiency eliminates both the penalty and the damage to self on crit. In addition it allows the use of any of a weapon's special properties.

Weapon proficiencies are taken for each subgroup (eg "Strikes" and "Throws" are a separate proficiencies).

- Unarmed combat
  - Strikes
  - Throws
  - Grapples
  - Disarms

## Detailed Skill Descriptions

Each skill has a number of described uses. However, the list is generally not exhaustive and additional uses should be discussed within the group. For each skill there are two important questions:

1. Can an entity try the roll again, and what are the consequences? If the answer is not "yes", then one cannot "take 20" or "take 24" in that skill.
2. Can an entity "take care" in that skill or not under appropriate circumstances (see  "[Take Care](base-rules.md#Taking%2024)")?

### STR Based

#### Athletics

Athletics is used for most land based physical activities including:

- Jumping beyond the ordinary jump distance as determined by a character's stats.
  - For long jumps distance = [Athletics Roll / 2] rounded up.
  - For every 10ft of base speed above 30ft, the roll gets a +1.
  - For high jumps distance off ground = [Athletics Roll / 5] rounded up.
  - If the entity does not have a run up of at least 10ft, or has not moved on its previous turn, the jump distance is halved.
- Lifting or moving objects that are above a character's normal capacity as determined by its stats, or that have an unwieldy shape. Carrying capacity is based on the "take care" rule.
  - A creature can drag up to [Athletics Roll x 20]lb.
  - A creature can lift up to [Athletics Roll x 10]lb of the ground.
  - A creature can lift over its head [Athletics Roll x 5]lb over its head.
  - For every size category above medium this number is doubled.
  - For every size category below medium, this number is halved.
- Throwing items and creatures beyond a normal distance.
  - More data needed.
- Outrunning creatures with the same base speed in short overland chases (opposed roll rules).
- Entertaining others with a feats of physical prowess (see "[Difficulties and recommended thresholds](base-rules.md#Difficulties%20and%20recommended%20thresholds)").
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, although the DM may rule that failure on a retry results in the "crippled" condition.

#### Climb

This is a skill specific to scaling steep or vertical surfaces, trees, ropes and entities larger than oneself. A creature without a *climb* skill climbs at 1/4 of its base speed. Unless otherwise stated, no action is required, and the roll is made as part of the entity's movement. This follows the "Difficulties and recommended thresholds" as follows.

- Base Thresholds:
  - 4: A steep embankment, ladder, knotted rope, or tree with many branches.
  - 8: A rope or near vertical rock with many big holds and ledges, or average tree.
  - 12: A branchless tree or lamp post or vertical wall with good holds, monkey bars.
  - 16: An slightly overhanging wall with good holds, or vertical wall (eg old brick wall).
  - 24: A steep overhanging wall with holds, or a well masoned town wall.
  - 30: A cave roof, steep overhanging wall with few holds, a perfectly masoned town wall.
  - 36: A ceiling or perfectly smooth glass/metal vertical wall
  - 50: A force wall or flowing waterfall.
- Modifiers:
  - Surface is wet: -5 Penalty.
  - Surface is loose: -5 Penalty.
  - Entity climbs at 1/2 speed or dash: -5 penalty.
  - Entity spends one hour studying the climb: Advantage.
- Special:
  - Entities with a climb speed can always "take care" to climb.
  - A roll of a climber's kit allows to make a climb safe, reducing fall distance to 20ft for threshold 24+ climbs and 10ft for threshold 23- climbs.
  - An entity that fails a climb roll fails to progress on a climb.
  - An entity that fails by 5 or more falls half the distance and suffers the consequences. If this is a critical fail, the entity falls the full distance.
- **Take care**: No. Entities without a climb speed are always considered at risk when climbing.
- **Try again**: Yes, but repeated fall damage on failure might make repeated attempts undesirable.

#### Fortify

The skill is used for building structures, fortifying positions (dungeon corridors, battle fields, encampments). It is also used for safely demolishing structures and fortifications. Lastly it is used for making a site safe from natural hazards and making it fit for encampment (amelioration). Fortification rolls are usually made against the threshold set by the terrain and weather.

- **Building**: There are special rules for building. They need to be written.
- **Fortification**: It takes 30min per 5ft square to fortify a position.
  - This can give a 3/4 cover bonus to defenders.
  - This can be used to construct a terrain/structure trap (see traps).
  - This can be used to create a barricade (with a break threshold of your roll).
- **Amelioration**: For medium size creature the minimum camping area is 5ft x 10ft.
  - It takes 10 minutes to ameliorate this area in threshold 10- terrain.
  - It takes 1h to ameliorate this area in threshold 11+ terrain.
- **Modifiers**:
  - The time can be reduced, but without special or supernatural abilities it cannot be less than 5 minutes.
  - For every size category above medium the total time taken is halved.
  - Multiple entities can participate in the process, in which case the time taken is divided by the number of entities taking part. For each size category above medium, an entity counts as twice as many entities of the next category down. So a large entity counts as 2 medium entities, but a huge entity counts as 4 medium entities.
  - An entity can do a "rush job" and take half the time: -5 penalty.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes.

#### Swim

Swimming is a separate skill from climbing and overland athletics. It is used for moving through a liquid medium, such as water, lava, quicksand, or a monster's stomach acid. A creature without a *swim* skill swims at 1/4 of its base speed. Unless otherwise stated, no action is required, and the roll is made as part of the entity's movement. This follows the "Difficulties and recommended thresholds" as follows.

- Base Thresholds:
  - 4: Float or swim in perfectly calm, warm water, under perfect conditions.
  - 8: To float or swim while engaged in combat.
  - 8: Swim in a direction while under water.
  - 50: Swim up a flowing waterfall or down an erupting volcano (if you're immune to Fire[Natural]).
- Threshold modifiers:
  - Severe or Extreme currents: +5 or +10 to threshold.
  - Severe or Extreme turbulence/waves: +5 or +10 to threshold.
  - Severe or Extreme temperature: +5 or +10 to threshold.
- Penalties:
  - Wearing medium armour: -5 penalty.
  - Wearing heavy armour: -10 penalty.
  - For every 10lb of carried equipment: -1 penalty.
- Special:
  - Entities with a swim speed can always "take care" to swim.
  - Floatation devices (improvised or purpose made) reduce thresholds for staying or returning to the surface by 5.
  - An entity with a diver's kit can see normally in the fluid, can swim at 1/2 base speed instead of 1/4 base speed, and does not need to worry about breath for 30 minutes. Usually a diver's kit is designed specifically for one fluid.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: No. The dynamic nature of failure and drowning makes it meaningless.

### DEX Based

#### Acrobatics

Acrobatics is used for complex dynamic movement and manoeuvres. Unless otherwise stated, no action is required, and the roll is made as part of the entity's movement.

- Substitute for climb if the climb distance is less than the entity's base movement.
  - On a fail the entity automatically falls the full distance.
- Avoid Attacks of Opportunity when moving through a set of threatened squares.
  - Threshold: [Attack Bonus of hostile] + 13.
- Ignore the damage for the first 10ft of a fall.
  - Deliberate fall: Threshold 12.
  - Not deliberate fall: Threshold 16.
- Move over narrow surfaces (adjust accordingly for entity size).:
  - 4: 1-2ft wide.
  - 8: 7-12 inches wide.
  - 12: 2-6 inches wide.
  - 16: Less than 2 inches wide.
- When moving over unstable or slippery surfaces. For threshold, start with 0 and add all modifiers that apply.
  - Slippery or Frictionless surface: +5 or +10.
  - Violent (eg ship in a storm) or extreme movement (eg earthquake or collapse): +5 or +10.
  - Slope (30-45 deg), Steep slope (45+): +2 or +5.
- Entertaining others with a feats of acrobatics or gymnastics (see "[Difficulties and recommended thresholds](base-rules.md#Difficulties%20and%20recommended%20thresholds)"). This generally represents at least one minute of performance.
- Failure of an acrobatics roll by 5 or more may result in falling. Failure by a lesser margin generally results in lack of progress.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, although the potential of falling often makes it meaningless.

#### Fly

I don't know whether we even need this as a skill. It is done as part of an entity's or vehicle's movement.

- **Maintain control** of one's trajectory in unfavourable conditions.
  - Threshold = 5 + [1 per 10mph] of wind speed.
  - Small entities start making rolls at 30mph. This increases by +10mph for each size category above "small", and flight category above "average".
- **Regain control** when falling.
  - Threshold = 10 + [turns falling or out of control].
- **Emulate higher flight** category (eg good flyer trying to hover). This is also used for manoeuvres.
  - Threshold = 10 + [5 x number of categories above current category].
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, although the DM can rule that repeated failure results in the "crippled" condition or damage to the vehicle.

#### Heal

Healing is used to use medical art and science (as opposed to magic) to diagnose and treat injury and illness. It usually takes at least a minute. It is fine to use WIS instead as a governing stat, especially for diagnosis.

- **Stabilise**: As an action, cure the "dying" condition.
  - Threshold = 15
- **First Aid**. As an action, cure "unconscious", or delay the effects of "crippled" or "bleeding" condition for 1 hour.
  - Threshold = 15 if [Natural]
  - Threshold = 25 if [Supernatural]
- **Treat poison**. Requires 1 minute - 1h of treatment:
  - Threshold = Threshold of poison.
- **Treat disease**. Requires 1 minute to 1 hour of treatment. Often requires several successes over consecutive days (see diseases).
  - Threshold = Threshold of disease.
- **Long term care**. Duration varies (at least 8h). Double number of HP regained over a long rest.
  - Threshold = 10 + [number of creatures x 2].
- **Diagnosis**. Diagnose disease, poison or condition.
  - Natural condition: 12
  - Supernatural condition: 20
  - Disease: Threshold of the disease or poison
  - It is usually fine to rule that once an entity has seen it once, it knows what it is.
- **Take care**: Yes, for treatment. No for diagnosis.
- **Try again**: For treatment, yes (although the patient might be dead by then). For "diagnose", no.

#### Ride

An entity riding a mount substitutes uses its move to control its mount and its own seat on it. In return it uses the mount's movement speed and modalities. Using a "run" or "sprint" action requires that a rider also uses their action. In addition rolls can be made to perform certain particular actions.

- **Substitute** for "Athletics" or "Acrobatics" for actions that start or end with the rider on the mount. For example this includes, dancing, jumping and falling.
- **Fight**: As a **communicate** action instruct your mount to make its attack.
  - War trained mount: Threshold = 12.
  - Untrained mount: Threshold = 24.
  - An "aggressive" mount will attack of its own accord, whether you want it to or not.
- **Control**: As a **communicate** action, keep control of your mount in combat.
  - Keep non combat trained mount in combat: Threshold = 24
  - Keep an "aggressive" mount from attacking available targets: Threshold = 16.
  - Control an uncooperative mount that is untrained or does not accept the rider. Threshold = Opposed roll vs Mount's charisma.
- **Stay in saddle**: Keep your seating under adverse circumstances (non-action).
  - Threshold = Threshold of provoking event.
  - On damage over 20, threshold = [damage suffered / 2]
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, where appropriate. For "fight" and "control" the threshold increases by 1 for every failure.

#### Sleight of Hand

Sleight of hand is not just for "hands". It is the skill combining the use of delicate and precise manipulations with one's body parts and the psychological know-how to make sure that they go unnoticed. It is usually a **main action**. The term "small" is not precise, and common sense should be used.

- **"Steal"**: Take a small unattended item into your possession without being noticed. This should also be used for replacing items or performing "magic" tricks or cheating at cards:
  - Threshold when not observed: 8 (It is possible to fail because one can fail spectacularly enough to still draw attention!)
  - Threshold when actively observed: Opposed vs Perception.
- **"Pick pocket"**: Take a small attended item into your possession without being noticed:
  - Threshold: Opposed vs [Perception (at advantage if entity has a sense of touch)].
- **"Liberate item"**: Remove a small jammed item or component of device or structure from where it belongs.
  - 8: Loosely jammed item (eg gem between wardrobe and wall).
  - 12: Tightly jammed item (eg lock of hair stuck in a door).
  - Add +4 to the threshold if the item has adhered.
  - Add +4 to the threshold if fingers (or other body parts) cannot reach.
- **"Liberate"**: Slip free of manacles and the like.
  - Threshold is threshold value of manacles (usually 20-36).
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, although for "steal" or "pick pocket" the threshold increases by +10 as any observers are likely to be wary this time.

#### Tinker

Tinkering involves making, modifying and breaking delicate mechanisms, constructions or devices. This includes things like gem cutting, watch making, disabling intricate traps and picking locks. Usually this is either difficult or impossible without additional proficiency with an appropriate kit. Disabling devices carefully usually takes a minute. Modifying them takes at least a minute, while crafting can take hours, days or longer (See Crafting for discussion of this topic).

- **Pick lock or disable trap**:  1 minute.
  - Threshold: Threshold of lock/trap.
  - Rush job (1 round): +10 to threshold.
  - Study: Spending an hour studying the lock/trap reduces threshold by 5.
  - Thresholds of locks generally range 20-36.
  - Thresholds of traps generally range 8-28 (but failure can be lethal).
- **Research device**: Spend time to understand how a device works. This then enables the entity to recreate the device (providing it has the appropriate skills and facilities) or gain a permanent +5 to disabling such devices.
  - Simple device (eg sand clock, thing that goes "dong"): Threshold = 12, time = 1 hour.
  - Average device (eg watermill): Threshold = 16, time = 4h.
  - Complex device (eg pendulum clock, steam engine): Threshold: 24, time = 1 week.
  - Masterpiece/unique mechanism (eg antikythera mechanism): Threshold = 30, time = 1 month.
  - If an entity takes double the time, it can reduce the threshold by -4.
  - If an entity wishes to do a rush job and half the time, increase the threshold by +10.
  - Research of complex (and higher) devices can be simplified by using assistants. The assistant must be proficient both in **tinker** and the appropriate tools. For each assistant reduce research time by 1 day, to a maximum of half the time (rounded up).
- **Create device**: Create a device whose general design you know.
  - Threshold: Varies.
- **Modify/sabotage device**: Modify the device to alter its function or cause it to disfunction in a specific manner.
  - Threshold: [Creation threshold + 4]
  - Time taken: Half the time to create the device.
- **Disable device**: Cause the device to stop functioning without causing immediate catastrophic failure.
  - Threshold: [Creation threshold]
  - Time taken: 1 minute for threshold 16 and below. 1 hour for threshold 24 and below. For higher thresholds, the DM should set a reasonable time.
  - An entity may attempt a rush job to reduce the times to 1 round, 1 minute (or ~1/10) by taking a -10 penalty.
- **Special**: Disabling the supernatural component of supernatural traps and devices increases the threshold by +10.
- **Take care**: Yes. for "disable", "create" or "modify". For "research", the time taken on the next check to research the same item doubles with each failure.
- **Try again**: Yes, if it hasn't blown up in your face yet!

### CON Based

#### Harvest

Harvest is the umbrella skill covering the harvesting of natural resources from the environment. This includes, gathering herbs, cutting wood, trapping small game, fishing and mining. For each individual type of harvesting proficiency with the tools is required to use the skill to its full potential. This reflects that each one is a separate discipline and often uses different tools and a different knowledge base.

- **Threshold**: Determined by terrain and weather. (See "Travel rolls and terrain")
- **Guideline yields**:
  - Hunt/trap small prey: 1 small creature per day + 1 per 5 points by which the terrain threshold is exceeded.
  - Strip a carcass (small, medium, large, huge, enormous): (30 min, 2h, 4h, 1d, 1 week). Threshold: (6, 9, 12, 18, 24).
  - Harvest surface plants/minerals: 5-30 min per 5ft. Threshold: Terrain.
  - Harvest subsurface minerals (mining): 1h-1d per 5ft Threshold: Terrain.
- **Modifiers and Special**.
  - If the resource is rare, or exotic increase the threshold by +5 or +10.
  - If the resource cannot be found in the terrain, then the time is spent and the harvest fails.
  - The duration of the "harvesting" and the magnitude of success determine the yield of the harvest. Critical failure results in the damage to the tools used (or HP loss or injury if the tool was the character's body or spirit).
  - Exceeding the threshold by 5 allows to double the yield or half the time. Exceeding by 10 or more, allows both.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes.

### INT Based

#### Academics

Academics are fundamental knowledge. It starts with literacy and ends in higher logic, mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, architecture, music theory and scientific method (although not actual scientific knowledge). Academics is generally used when creating or deciphering secret messages, doing research, showing off, or getting a clue from the DM. This can be a minute worth of contemplation, or weeks of dedicated study.

- **Create/Decipher** secret meaning: Create or solve a cipher. Leave or discern a secret message.
  - **Time taken**: 1 minute if threshold 12 or below. 1 hour if threshold is 20 or below. 1 day if 32 or below. Longer if higher.
  - **Threshold**: Depends. See "[Difficulties and recommended thresholds](base-rules.md#Difficulties%20and%20recommended%20thresholds)".
- **Show off**: A character may attempt an opposed academics roll to "persuade" or "bluff" under certain circumstances. Alternatively this can be used to attempt to explain certain theories to others. This can make things better or worse. Can substitute for "Perform" in academic audiences.
- **Discern logic:** Use of cold analysis to discern a logical inconsistency in words or actions of entities. This is a full round action.
  - Threshold: Opposed roll if deception is performed. Threshold should be equal to at least 15 otherwise.
- **Research**: Attempt to understand a phenomenon, theory or puzzle. Can also be used to understand devices but requires proficiency in the appropriate tools. This requires time and an appropriately equipped space (usually). The benefits are either a narrative answer or a +4 insight bonus to dealing with this kind of "thing" in the future.
  - Simple phenomenon: 1 hour, Threshold = 12.
  - Complex phenomenon: 1 week+, Threshold = 24.
  - Grand theory: 1 month+, Threshold = 32. (eg complete the unfinished theorem of a great sage of old).
  - Unique phenomenon: 1 month+, Threshold = 32+. (eg gain an understanding of what powers the fragment of another world that one day appeared in the countryside)
  - Develop countermeasures to a monster's ability and gain a +4 to saves/attack against it. This requires at least one knowledge skill.
    - Time taken: [Monster SP + MP dice] x days
    - Threshold: [(Monster SP + MP dice) / 2]
- **Recognise theory**: Recognise a theory or phenomenon you have previously studied.
  - Threshold = [Research threshold - 5]
- **Take care**: No. Knowledge and thought have too many hidden variables to take care.
- **Try again**: For knowledge based roll, deciphering and logical clues, one retry at a -10 penalty is allowed. For Research, yes, although given the time and material use, it is often undesirable.

#### Appraise

Appraise is used to determine the value of an item, as well as to determine its origin and condition. It takes a "full round action".

- **Assess condition**: Threshold = 10.
- **Determine origin**: Threshold = 15.
- **Full Appraise**: Threshold = 20.
- The thresholds are modified as follows:
  - Item is rare or unique: +5 or +10.
  - Item is from a distant time or space, or from another realm or epoch: +5 or + 10.
- **Detect forgery**: Threshold = Threshold of forgery.
- **Special**: If the check fails it may still reveal partial information, although the part for the failure will still give a false value. For example, rolling 21 to appraise a rare vase will may give a wildly inaccurate value, but still reveal the correct origin and condition.
- **Take care**: No.
- **Try again**: No. Same result.

#### Investigate/Prospect

This is a wide range of skills and methods that are used to reveal hidden details and properties of the surrounding area. Detailed use is described in "Scouting, prospecting and exploration". The DM should take care not to put plot critical information behind this kind of check (or any other check really, this one is overdone). In addition this skill can be used for "detective" functions like:

- **Date Evidence**: Determine the approximate age of evidence. Can also be used for tracks, food stuffs, etc:
  - Exactly: Threshold = 32
  - Within 5%: Threshold = 24
  - Within 10%: Threshold = 20
  - Within 25%: Threshold = 16
  - When evidence gets to a certain age, any further deterioration can make it impossible to date. Therefore the DM should use common sense (eg "This blood is exactly 129381 years, 4 days and 3 minutes old!" is silly).
- **Detect Tampering**: Determine that something has been tampered with or if there is something that is missing.
  - Threshold = Threshold of roll used to tamper.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes.

#### Navigate

Navigation allows a character to orientate themselves in space, find the best route from A to B, hold a course, or to plan logistics. In conjunction with cartographers' tools it can be used to create wonderful maps. Navigation can be anything from a "full round action" for orientating one-self, to a drawn out process for planning logistics.

- **Find north:** Orientate your direction. Useful in unknown terrain. This is a full round action.
  - Threshold = [Threshold of terrain with weather modifier - 5]
- **Hold course:** Maintain your direction of travel when circumstances change (eg weather changes). This is a "secondary action".
  - Threshold = [Threshold of terrain with weather modifier - 10]
- **Orientate:** Use map and compass to locate yourself (eg when lost). This takes a minute.
  - Threshold = [Threshold of terrain with weather modifier]
  - Rush job (take "full round action" instead): Increase threshold by + 5.
- **Plan route/logistics:** Plan out a route between two points. On a success, the party will be given the route that fulfills the desired criteria as closely as possible, pointing out potential hazards. The journey time will also be decreased by 10%.
  - **Action**: 1 hour / day of route. 2 hours / day if logistics are included.
  - **Threshold**: [Terrain threshold] + [1 / 5 entities in the group] + [1 per vehicle in the group].
- **Forecast**: Predict weather up to 24h ahead. The threshold = [terrain with weather modifier].
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes. If the situation changes, or extra data is gathered. Otherwise the result is the same.

#### Knowledge

There are 6 knowledge skills in the game. Each represents various subsets of knowledge. Each skill works symmetrically and deals with recalling information from one of the fields of knowledge. Using a knowledge skill is a non-action.

- **General Thresholds**:
  - 4: Common knowledge, everyone knows this! (eg Dragons exist.)
  - 8: Common knowledge, more than half the villagers know this. (eg There are dragons in the northern mountains.)
  - 16: Basic specialist knowledge, known eg. only by a few folk in the village/town. (eg, The dragons in the mountains slumber, but there is one not far from here that is awakening, it's lair is somewhere on the side of mount X.)
  - 24: Truly specialist knowledge, which is known by only the most knowledgeable in the region. (eg. The dragon's name is Bob, he is five centuries old, has a magical gem instead of one of its eyes and has sworn to destroy the kingdom when the moon turns blue)
  - 32: Deep knowledge, known by few or forgotten by most who once knew it. (eg The dragon's crystal eye works by these magics and can be destroyed using that method. 543 years ago to the day, queen Alice tricked and killed Bob's mate and then used her scales to make herself a suit of armour which is currently said to be lost in the ruins of XYZ. Bob's rage against the kingdom will likely not abate until the scales of his mate are returned.)
  - A DM may give completely false results on a failed check to obfuscate information that can be gleaned from information theory.
- **Knowledge Domains**:
  - **Arcana**: Knowledge of spells and magical rituals. Used to identify magical auras (with appropriate senses), supernatural effects, spells that are being cast, magical constructs and summoned creature. Thresholds:
    - Identify magical aura: 16.
    - Identify supernatural effect: [12 + MP dice used to create it]
    - Identify spell being cast [12 + MP dice used to create it]
    - Identify magical constructs or summoned creature: [4 + Total dice / 2].
    - If the item is a single use item and the roll fails by 5 or more, the item is destroyed in the process.an assign [MP + 2] to successfully counter the effect.
  - **Dungeoneering**: A collection of esoteric fields dealing with dangerous places such as labyrinths, monster lairs and disaster zones. It includes knowledge of things like creatures dwell in such places, typical hazards and resources, likely locations of trap/treasure zones and core zones, and general dungeon trivia. Thresholds are as follows:
    - Identify monstrous creature or construct: [4 + Total dice / 2]
      - Special: for every 4 points over the identification threshold, the character gains an extra piece of information about the creature.
    - Identify hazard: [terrain + weather] or [threshold of creation].
    - Identify material/dweomer in such a zone: See "[Appraise](#Appraise)".
    - Identify structure of zone: [terrain + weather] + 5.
  - **Geography**: Geography and geology. Including, know geography and geology of a region. Identify landmarks. Identify regional belonging of an entity from its outwards traits and behaviour.
  - **History**: Know the history of a region, item or civilisation. Know obscure historical events of significance. Know power structure of a country and know details of past and present rulers. Remember what you did two sessions ago if you forgot to make notes.
  - **Nature**: Identify "natural" entities and know their properties. Identify natural cycles, phenomena and hazards (including diseases). Identify natural materials.
    - Identify natural entity: [4 + total dice / 2]
      - Special: for every 4 points over the identification threshold, the character gains an extra piece of information about the creature.
    - Identify phenomenon, hazard or cycle: [terrain + weather bonus]
    - Identify natural materials: See "[appraise](#Appraise)".
  - Religion: Know about gods, supernatural beings and religious practices.
    - Identify supernatural being: [4 + Total dice / 2].
- **Special**: Identifying beings by setting thresholds based on "Total dice" can get silly. Most people would know a dragon when they see one. As such general knowledge threshold can be used instead.
- **Take care**: No. You either know it or don't.
- **Try again**: no. You either know it or don't.

### WIS Based

#### Observe

The skill of observation is used to notice hidden/camouflaged details, entities or items using one's senses. If a character fails to observe another entity, the character is effectively "blinded" with respect to the entity. A character that fails to perceive an ambushing party at the start of combat is considered "surprised", which is not a lot of fun.

- **Observe hidden entity**:
- **Modifiers on observed entity**:
  - Medium item in plain sight: Threshold = 0
  - Per size category larger: - 5
  - Per size category smaller: + 5
  - Poor Visibility: + 5
  - Partial concealment: + 2
  - Per 20ft of distance: + 1
  - Per additional entity: -1
  - Through solid object (eg wall): Disadvantage (auto fail for some senses like sight)
- **Modifiers on perceiving entity**:
  - Maintaining "concentration": Disadvantage
  - Asleep: - 10
- **Special**: Observe always succeeds against an entity or item in plain sight within 60ft, unless certain special abilities or conditions are in play (eg "invisible", "blinded").
- **Take care**: No. This is essentially random.
- **Try again**: Yes. In this case this is a "secondary action".

#### Sense Motive

See through deception or gain some insight into the motive or state of mind of an entity. Usually this is through paying careful attention to wording, intonation and body language combined with a thorough knowledge of philosophy. No action required. This skill does not allow one to read an entity's mind (usually).

- **Discern Deception**: Opposed vs "deception".
- **Sense motive**: Gain insight into motive. Threshold = 16.
- **Empathise**: Gain insight into emotional state of entity. Threshold = 12.
- **Read surface thought**: Read the surface thoughts of an entity of the same race:
  - Threshold: 32
  - Action: "full round action"
- **Modifiers**
  - Charmed creatures have disadvantage on deception vs those who charmed them.
  - Different culture in same entity kind: -2 penalty.
  - Different race in same entity kind: -5 penalty.
  - Different entity kind: -10 penalty.
  - Familiar with entity: +2 bonus.
  - Intimately familiar with entity: +5 bonus.
- **Take care**: No. Too many random factors.
- **Try again**: Yes (as "secondary action"), but the result will be the same or the state of mind will have changed and the previous one will not be deduced.

#### Spellworking

While 'Knowledge:Arcana" deals with theory, this is the practical application of said theory to manipulate supernatural forces and magical energies. It is used mainly to interact with the supernatural by "natural"/mundane means. This includes attempting to disrupt a ritual or modify its outcome. Alter the effect of arcane/spiritual glyphs and barriers and imbue or disimbue supernatural forces into mundane/"natural" objects. This generally takes between 1 minute and 1 week but can take longer. It should be noted that many barriers and other dweomer have wards against tampering. This can end badly.

- **Threshold** = creator's [Sup] roll.
- **Time required** based on threshold:
  - Up to 12: 1 minute.
  - Up to 16: 1 hour.
  - Up to 24: 1 day.
  - Up to 32: 1 week.
  - For every 8 points the threshold is exceeded, the time category reduces by one (eg, rolling 33 vs a threshold=24 barrier means it will take an hour to disable it).
- **Disable supernatural trap:** Safely disenchant or diffuse a magical trap (1 minute).
- **Create bypass in supernatural barrier**: Allow a passage big enough to accommodate for 1 medium size entity in a magical barrier for 1 minute.
- **Extend duration**: Enforce a supernatural effect, extending the duration (requires 1 hour). Roll vs the Creator's [Sup] roll. On success the effect is extended by:
  - Duration =  [roll - threshold] x 10% of original duration.
- **Edit enchantment**
  - **Alter element**: Change the element of an existing effect to a different element.
  - **Alter conditions**: Change the triggering or safety condition of the enchantment.
  - **Alter effect**: Alter the effect. NB: Threshold is [creator's [Sup] roll + 10].
- **Imbue**: This is covered in the "crafting" section, and basically uses pathfinder rules.
- **Disimbue**: Disimbue an enchantment, dissipating the energy.
  - **Special**: If you fail this roll by less than 5 but roll snake eyes, the energy is released in a catastrophic cascade dealing [threshold] x d6 "light"[Sup] damage to everything within [threshold] x 5ft of the source.
- **Absorb**: Disimbue an enchantment and absorb the energy as MP dice.
  - If the item is a single use item and the roll fails by 5 or more, the item is destroyed in the process. On success the enchantment is disimbued and you replenish a number of MP dice equal to the number used to create the effect. Excess dice are added as temporary dice. If the resulting total dice is more than 3/2 times your maximum, two things happen:
    1. All your [MP] and [SP] dice are expended, your [HP] drops to zero. You are considered dying.
    2. All OTHER entities suffer the consequence as from a "catastrophic cascade" (see "disimbue" above).
- **Use magic device**: A character not proficient with a magical device can attempt to use it (this is a full round action unless it is normally longer). A roll is needed for each of:
  - Equip item.
  - Activate function or cast spell from item (-5 to threshold).
  - The threshold is the item's creation threshold.
  - If the item is a single use item and the roll fails by 5 or more, the item is destroyed in the process (unless it is "durable" or "indestructible").
  - For each restriction on the item forbidding the character to use it, the threshold increases by +5.
- **Special**: Failure by 5 or more leads to the entity using the skill to expend a number of MP dice equal to the difference between threshold and result. If this leads to the MP dice count reaching 0, the skill user must make a [CHA] save vs the threshold or fall "unconscious" until they receive "first aid" or the status is otherwise lifted by use of natural or supernatural ability.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, although by then it's often too late.

#### Track

Tracking is used to follow entities based on disturbances they leave in their environment. Finding tracks is a "full round action", while following tracks or identifying them is a "secondary action". One check is needed for every hour of pursuit or every mile if speed is less than 1mph.

- **Threshold:** For the fresh tracks of a single medium sized creature it is as follows:
  - Fluid: 28
  - Rock/hard ground: 20
  - Unstable ground (eg sand, powder snow): 16
  - Dirt road: 8
  - Snow or soft ground: 4
- **Modifiers**
  - For every size category up: -1 to threshold.
  - For every size category down: +1 to threshold.
  - For every additional entity: -1 to threshold.
  - If it has rained or fresh snow has fallen since: + 5 to threshold
  - For every day that has passed: +4 to threshold
  - Other modifiers may be applied.
- **Special**
  - "Prospect" or "observe" may be used to find tracks but not follow them.
  - If a group tried to mislead the tracker, the threshold may increase by [roll - 15].
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes. (Although you probably won't catch it if you take 20)

#### Use Dweomer

Probably going to roll this into "Spellworking".

### CHA Based

#### Creature Handling

Train a non-sapient entity or order/direct it to act. Training usually takes days, weeks, months or years. Commanding is a "communicate" action where the command is vocal or telepathic, or a "secondary action" when it is somatic. It can also be used for handling untamed creatures. This skill is generally not useable for entities with Int higher than 4. Those are treated as sapient.

- **Raise**: Rear a creature from infancy to adulthood. This also involves teaching the entity a number of commands equal to its intelligence score.
  - **Duration**: varies with life cycle.
  - **Threshold**: Base threshold for a native domestic animal is 12.
    - +4 if the entity is not a domestic breed.
    - +4 if it is not native to the terrain and climate where you are raising it.
    - +4 if it is a monstrosity or plant.
    - +8 if it is a different non-animal entity.
- **Tame**: Tame a wild thing. This has two modes. a) Interact with an entity and move its perception of you to "neutral". This takes a minute. b) Tame an entity. This takes between a week and a year depending on entity.
  - **Threshold**: Base threshold for a wild entity is 16.
    - -4 if it has had friendly interactions with your race or similar entities.
    - +4 if it is not an animal.
    - +8 if it has had hostile interactions with your race or similar entities.
    - +16 if it has had hostile interaction with you before.
- **Teach**: Teach an adult entity a new command.
  - **Duration**: 1 week (can be longer or shorter).
  - **Threshold**: base threshold for a domestic animal is 16.
    - +4 if this is not a natural activity for the entity (eg. Teaching a guinea pig to attack).
    - +4 if the entity is not an animal.
    - +4 for each command above the entity's intelligence score.
- **Command**: Order an entity to carry out a command.
  - **Threshold**: The base threshold is 16.
    - -4 to threshold if you trained it.
    - +8 if it is not trained for this command.
    - +12 if it is an untamed entity.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Sometimes, but at disadvantage. Raising cannot be repeated, because it already grew up.

#### Deceive

This is deception, whereby by direct lies (verbal, or by suggestive body language) or indirect deception or attempts to mislead. As a rule this skill should be used for direct interaction. Written form or sabotage use other skills. This is usually a "communicate" action.

- **Threshold**: Opposed to "Sense Motive".
- **Modifiers**
  - The target knows that this cannot feasibly be true: +16 threshold.
  - The deception is unlikely: +4 threshold.
  - The target is unfriendly (skeptical): +4 threshold.
  - The target wants to believe this is true: Advantage on deception roll.
- **Secret message**:
- **Distract**: Give a target disadvantage on mental skill/ability rolls till the end of its next turn (or a minute out of combat).
- **Take care**: No. Emotions are tricky.
- **Try again**: Sometimes, but at disadvantage. Sometimes a target may become hostile on failure and then things get messy.

### CHA: Intimidate

**NB:** Uses of intimidate in PC vs PC is not encouraged (except for "shake resolve"). For maximum effect this is one check that benefits from being roleplayed out.

Encourage compliance based on fear. This can be used either force NPCs to take a certain course of action out of fear or sense of self preservation. It can also be used to shake the resolve of a combatant for a brief moment. This skill has no effect on "fearless" entities.

- **Threshold**: Opposed roll vs Cha save. Snake eyes do NOT automatically fail this save.
  - +8 to threshold if you are hopelessly outmatched.
  - +4 to threshold if you are outnumbered or outsized.
  - -4 to threshold if you and allies outnumber or outsize target.
  - -8 to threshold if your target is hopelessly outmatched.
- **Intimidate**: Spend a minute being scary. The target will act as if it is **charmed** for as long as you are present (up to an hour, then a new roll may be required at the DMs discretion). When you are no longer present the target becomes "unfriendly" if it wasn't already, and may become hostile under some circumstances, but is unlikely to attack you directly. If the check fails, the target's attitude changes to "unfriendly" or "hostile" depending on multiple factors.
  - This may be used on multiple targets. The targets roll once as a group, using the Cha save of the perceived leader with a +1 for every extra member up to 10.
- **Shake resolve**: Use "communication" action to give target disadvantage on its next targeted attack or save.
  - If a "main action" is used instead target is "Frightened" until the end of its next turn.
- **Break**: Uses a "main action" to cow enemies into surrendering. The roll has the following penalties:
  - -12 penalty if you have done at least 1 HP damage to the target this encounter.
  - -16 penalty if the target has taken at least 1 HP damage in this encounter.
  - -24 penalty if the target is uninjured.
- **Take care**: No.
- **Try again**: Yes, once, with disadvantage. Subsequent checks automatically fail until circumstances change.

#### Persuade

Unlike intimidate this does not act as a charm effect. Like intimidate it should not be used on PCs. Persuasion can range from a systematic encroachment onto an entity's system of values and world view over many days of work, to a desperate plea thrown out in a "communicate" action. It can be used in or out of combat.

- **Threshold**: Opposed roll vs Cha save. Snake eyes do NOT automatically fail this save. NB: The DM is encouraged to set their own thresholds, instead of using a save, but this is a guide in doing so.
  - **Basic Threshold Modifiers**:
    - +16 if you or your request fundamentally contradicts the aims or values of the target.
    - +12 if you or your request is utterly ridiculous or completely contradicts values of target.
    - +8 if you or your request puts the target at a disadvantage.
    - +4 if you or your request causes the target inconvenience.
    - -4 if you or your request seem likely to be advantageous to the target.
    - -8 if you or your request is something the target wants to do anyway.
    - -16 if you or your request completely align with the aims and values of the target.
  - **Relationship Modifiers**: Based on relationship to you a target is likely to perceive requests differently. The threshold is affected as follows:
    - Nemesis (eg the one who swore they would cast your soul into the nether hells after seeing you slay their family before their eyes): +16
    - Hostile (eg the ogre trying to kill you): +8
    - Unfriendly (eg local thugs): +4
    - Friendly (eg good neighbour): - 4
    - Allied (eg good ally, spouse): -8
    - Sworn (eg The blink dog that you saved from monsters as a pup): -16
- **Request**: Spend at least one minute supplicating the target for aid. A successful roll means that the target will assist you in this request. Depending on its character it may or may not be particularly diligent or thorough in doing so.
- **Carouse**: Spend at least one hour interacting with the target, to attempt to shift its relationship one step closer to "allied".
  - Apart from under special circumstances a target will only advance one step up per day at most.
- **Beg for mercy**: As a "main action" you can beg for mercy in combat, making a persuade roll at disadvantage. On a successful roll you will be spared by your foe. If you fail by more than 5, you will become the main target.
- **Call for parley**: As a "full round action" you can call for parley, making a persuade roll at disadvantage. In most cases you have a penalty from both "relationship modifiers" and "basic threshold modifiers". If HP damage has been caused in this encounter, you have an additional -8 penalty. If you fail by 5 or more, you become the main target of the hostilities.
- **Special**:
  - Persuade checks for "Carouse" and "Request" always fail against a "Nemesis".
  - "Carouse" cannot move a relationship to "Sworn".
  - A "persuade" will only work on "nemesis" under circumstances where their goals are almost certain to fail otherwise, and sometimes not even then.
- **Take care**: No.
- **Try again**: Yes, once, with disadvantage. Subsequent checks automatically fail until circumstances change.

#### Perform

Put on a show or act, using word or play, song or dance, instrumentals or baffoonery or any number of other means. This can either be done to earn a living, distract attention, carouse or gain information. A performance typically lasts at least a minute.

- **Carouse**: Can be used to shift relationships one step in either direction between "hostile" and "friendly" for yourself or a different entity. (See "Persuade" rules above.)
- **Distract**: Make a perform roll vs a threshold of the target's Wis save. On a success the target has disadvantage on "observe" and "sense motive" checks while your performance continues. If the target gets snake eyes, it is "charmed" for the duration of your performance.
- **Gather information**: Works as a "knowledge" skill with a scope limited to what the entities at the performance would know.
- **General descriptors by roll result**
  - 4: My 3 year old's screams are less painful to listen to.
  - 8: Basically Begging.
  - 12: Amateur Busking.
  - 16: Enjoyable professional performance.
  - 20: A memorable performance.
  - 24: An impressive performance worthy of a famous bard.
  - 30: A performance worthy of the royal court.
  - 36: A dragon might kidnap you just to fall asleep to your lullaby.
  - 50: This music can quite literally sway the gods or raise the dead.
