# Skills
This section covers which skills exist and how they are used.

#### Skills and Proficiencies.
The game has **skills** and **proficiencies**. The game defines them as follows. They do not necessarily reflect "real life" with perfect accuracy.
- **Skills:** are general abilities that cover a range of activities that a character can learn and improve in with time. For example, **swimming** is a skill because it covers, swimming, diving and similar, and a character's ability to swim is graded. Eg. "I can't swim", "I can swim but not well", "I can cross a river, yeah", "I've swam 20 miles, it took me 3 hours".
- **Proficiencies:** A proficiency is the knowledge and ability in using every specific set of tools or abilities. Having a **proficiency** allows a character to use a skill with the tool/ability with a skill. Eg. Proficiency in **lock picks** with a **tinker** check allows picking locks. Proficiency with **whale** allows you to use **diplomacy** skill to persuade whales when speaking in their language.

#### Acquiring skills and proficiencies
Skills are usually acquired at level up by either assigning skill points or adding background skills. This reflects time spent honing skills through us on adventure and picking up new skills and techniques by training. Certain special abilities also grant additional skills and proficiencies.

It is NOT adviseable to allow a character to gain additional skill points outside of this unless it is necessary for party balance or plot reasons. Even then it should not be taken lightly. As an optional rule and downtime activity it takes a solid month of training to gain 1 skill point and the total number of points (ranks) in a skill cannot exceed [LVL]/2. Certain supernatural abilities can also transfer a skill from one entity to another, but no entity should use them lightly.

#### Skill points (ranks)
A character gets skill points (ranks) based on level and intelligence. The maximum number of points (ranks) in one skill is as follows:
  - **[LEVEL / 2] rounded up**.

Every level a character gains skill points equal to **3 + [INT]**. So at level LVL a character has **[LVL] x (3 + [INT])** skill points.

A skill point can be assigned to either a) gain a proficiency, or b) add a rank to a skill. Each level a character can reassign one of the previously assigned skill points to a different proficiency or skill. If a character has **zero** ranks in a skill, any roll of the dice (before modifiers!) in that skill above 12 counts as 12. This reflects lack of specialist knowledge and experience that that character lacks.

#### Base and "background" bonus
Every level a character adds a "background" skill to add its **base** to. This cannot be reassigned later. At level N a character has N skills which are assigned as background skills. This reflects knowledge in untrained skills that a character has picked up over their adventures, travels and other lifetime experience without actual training.

#### Total Skill bonus
A character has a skill bonus of **[Base (optional)] + [ranks] + [ability bonus]**. So a character with INT = +2, and 2 ranks in "swim" has a +4 to swim. If they have assigned "swim" as a backround skill, and their base is +1, the total bonus is +5.

#### Circumstance bonus
Sometimes circumstances may add a +2/+5 to a roll (eg Homeland bonus for navigation). Sometimes they may cause advantage or disadvntage. Sometimes they are codified in the rules, sometimes the DM may apply them as appropriate.

#### Skill groups
Some skills are similar to each other as to be somewhat transferable. In this case the character may roll a different skill from the same group with a -5 penalty. The groups are:

#### Skills list:

##### Language Proficiencies
There are as many language proficiencies as there are languages in your setting. In order to speak, understand, read and write a language a character must be proficient in it.

Optionally, for gritty settings language proficiency does not grant a character the ability to read and write, and they must have a rank in "academics" in order to read or write. This, however, makes "academics" very strong.

##### Tool Proficiencies
Using tools usually requires a roll of an associated skill. Some skills cannot be used for certain purposes unless At the group's discretion it can makes sense for other skills may be associated with a tool (eg woodworking tools being used with **fortify** for making big items like wooden walls). Tools and their properties are further discussed below (in the "tools" sections).

##### Armour Proficiencies
Any entity whose body fits a suit of armour can wear the armour. As such it will get the normal benefit to the hit threshold.

When an entity dons or doffs an armour it is not proficient with, it twice as long to don and doff the armour as normal.
While an entity is wearing an armour it is not proficient with it takes a -5 penalty to all [DEX] and [STR] based rolls it makes.

Armour and its properties are further discussed in the "Weapons and Armour Section".

There are three armour proficiencies that each cover several groups of armour.

  - Full Padded
  - Leather Cuirass

##### Weapon Proficiencies
Weapons are tools that increase an entity's lethality in combat. For the sake of this definition, this does not include martial or supernatural abilities. Weapons and their properties are further discussed in the "Weapons and Armour Section".

Any entity may wield a weapon it is physically capably of wielding. If it is not proficent, it makes attacks with a -5 penalty. On a critical fail it damages itself, rolling the same damage dice it would as if it had hit the intended target.

Proficiency eliminates both the penalty and the damage to self on crit. In addition it allows the use of any of a weapon's special properties.

Weapon proficiencies are taken for each subgroup (eg "Strikes" and "Throws" are a separate proficiencies).
