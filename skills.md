# Skills
This section covers which skills exist and how they are used.

#### Skills and Proficiencies.
The game has **skills** and **proficiencies**. The game defines them as follows. They do not necessarily reflect "real life" with perfect accuracy.
- **Skills:** are general abilities that cover a range of activities that a character can learn and improve in with time. For example, **swimming** is a skill because it covers, swimming, diving and similar, and a character's ability to swim is graded. Eg. "I can't swim", "I can swim but not well", "I can cross a river, yeah", "I've swam 20 miles, it took me 3 hours".
- **Proficiencies:** A proficiency is the knowledge and ability in using every specific set of tools or abilities. Having a **proficiency** allows a character to use a skill with the tool/ability with a skill. Eg. Proficiency in **lock picks** with a **tinker** check allows picking locks. Proficiency with **whale** allows you to use **diplomacy** skill to persuade whales when speaking in their language.

#### Acquiring skills and proficiencies
Skills are usually acquired at level up by either assigning skill points or adding background skills. This reflects time spent honing skills through us on adventure and picking up new skills and techniques by training. Certain special abilities also grant additional skills and proficiencies.

It is NOT adviseable to allow a character to gain additional skill points outside of this unless it is necessary for party balance or plot reasons. Even then it should not be taken lightly. As an optional rule and downtime activity it takes a solid month of training to gain 1 skill point and the total number of points (ranks) in a skill cannot exceed [LVL]/2. Certain supernatural abilities can also transfer a skill from one entity to another, but no entity should use them lightly.

#### Skill points (ranks)
A character gets skill points (ranks) based on level and intelligence. The maximum number of points (ranks) in one skill is as follows:
  - **[LEVEL / 2] rounded up**.

Every level a character gains skill points equal to **3 + [INT]**. So at level LVL a character has **[LVL] x (3 + [INT])** skill points.

A skill point can be assigned to either a) gain a proficiency, or b) add a rank to a skill. Each level a character can reassign one of the previously assigned skill points to a different proficiency or skill. If a character has **zero** ranks in a skill, any roll of the dice (before modifiers!) in that skill above 12 counts as 12. This reflects lack of specialist knowledge and experience that that character lacks.

#### Base and "background" bonus
Every level a character adds a "background" skill to add its **base** to. This cannot be reassigned later. At level N a character has N skills which are assigned as background skills. This reflects knowledge in untrained skills that a character has picked up over their adventures, travels and other lifetime experience without actual training.

#### Total Skill bonus
A character has a skill bonus of **[Base (optional)] + [ranks] + [ability bonus]**. So a character with INT = +2, and 2 ranks in "swim" has a +4 to swim. If they have assigned "swim" as a backround skill, and their base is +1, the total bonus is +5.

#### Circumstance bonus
Sometimes circumstances may add a +2/+5 to a roll (eg Homeland bonus for navigation). Sometimes they may cause advantage or disadvntage. Sometimes they are codified in the rules, sometimes the DM may apply them as appropriate.

#### Skill groups
Some skills are similar to each other as to be somewhat transferable. In this case the character may roll a different skill from the same group with a -5 penalty. The groups are:

#### Skills list:
There are 32 skills and a number of proficiencies.

##### Language Proficiencies
There are as many language proficiencies as there are languages in your setting. In order to speak, understand, read and write a language a character must be proficient in it.

Optionally, for gritty settings language proficiency does not grant a character the ability to read and write, and they must have a rank in "academics" in order to read or write. This, however, makes "academics" very strong.

##### Tool Proficiencies
Using tools usually requires a roll of an associated skill. Some skills cannot be used for certain purposes unless At the group's discretion it can makes sense for other skills may be associated with a tool (eg woodworking tools being used with **fortify** for making big items like wooden walls). Tools and their properties are further discussed below (in the "tools" sections).

- Athletics group based:
  - Diver's tools
  - Climber's kit
- Fortify based
  - Entrenching tools
  - Mason's tools
  - Smith's Tools

  - Cartographer's tools
- Perform
  - Disguise kit
  - Gaming Set (pick by group or individually)
  - Musical Instrument (pick by group or individually)


##### Armour Proficiencies
Any entity whose body fits a suit of armour can wear the armour. As such it will get the normal benefit to the hit threshold.

When an entity dons or doffs an armour it is not proficient with, it twice as long to don and doff the armour as normal.
While an entity is wearing an armour it is not proficient with it takes a -5 penalty to all [DEX] and [STR] based rolls it makes.

Armour and its properties are further discussed in the "Weapons and Armour Section".

There are three armour proficiencies that each cover several groups of armour.
- Light armours
  - Full Padded
  - Leather Cuirass
  - Chain Shirt
- Medium armours
  - Full Leather
  - Hide armour
  - Metal Cuirass
  - Any Paper Armour
- Heavy Armour
  - Full Chain
  - Full Splint
  - Full Chain
  - Half Plate
  - Full Plate
  - Any Adamantine Armour
- Shields
  - Buckler
  - Round Shield
  - Kite Shield
  - Tower Shield


##### Weapon Proficiencies
Weapons are tools that increase an entity's lethality in combat. For the sake of this definition, this does not include martial or supernatural abilities. Weapons and their properties are further discussed in the "Weapons and Armour Section".

Any entity may wield a weapon it is physically capably of wielding. If it is not proficent, it makes attacks with a -5 penalty. On a critical fail it damages itself, rolling the same damage dice it would as if it had hit the intended target.

Proficiency eliminates both the penalty and the damage to self on crit. In addition it allows the use of any of a weapon's special properties.

Weapon proficiencies are taken for each subgroup (eg "Strikes" and "Throws" are a separate proficiencies).
- Unarmed combat
  - Strikes
  - Throws
  - Grapples
  - Disarms
- Melee
  - One handed blade
  - Two handed blade
  - Axes
  - Light Percussive
  - Heavy Percussive

  - Staves
- Melee/Thrown
  - Light/Thrown blades
  - Spears/Javelins
- Ranged
  - Slings
  - Bows
  - Mechanical bows
  - Firearms (optional)
- Heavy
  - Ballistae
  - Trebuche/catapults
  - Canons

##### SKill Descriptions
Each skill has a number of described uses. However, the list is generally not exhaustive and additional uses should be discussed within the group. For each skill there are two important questions:

1. Can an entity try the roll again, and what are the consequences? If the answer is not "yes", then one cannot "take 20" or "take 24" in that skill.
2. Can an entity "take care" in that skill or not under approprtiate circumstances (see the "take care") section?

__STR: Athletics__

Athletics is used for most land based physical activities including:
- Jumping beyond the ordinary jump distance as determined by a character's stats.
  - For long jumps distance = [Athletics Roll / 2] rounded up.
  - For every 10ft of base speed above 30ft, the roll gets a +1.
  - For high jumps distance off ground = [Athletics Roll / 5] rounded up.
  - If the entity does not have a run up of at least 10ft, or has not moved on its previous turn, the jump distance is halved.
- Lifting or moving objects that are above a character's normal capacity as determined by its stats, or that have an unwieldy shape. Carrying capacity is based on the "take care" rule.
  - A creature can drag up to [Athletics Roll x 20]lb.
  - A creature can lift up to [Athletics Roll x 10]lb of the ground.
  - A creature can lift over its head [Athletics Roll x 5]lb over its head.
  - For every size category above medium this number is doubled.
  - For every size category below medium, this number is halved.
- Throwing items and creatures beyond a normal distance.
  - More data needed.
- Outrunning creatures with the same base speed in short overland chases (opposed roll rules). 
- Entertaining others with a feats of physical prowess (see "Difficulties and recommended thresholds").
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, although the DM may rule that failure on a retry results in the "crippled" condition.

__STR: Climb__

This is a skill specific to scaling steep or vertical surfaces, trees, ropes and entites larger than oneself. A creature without a *climb* skill climbs at 1/4 of its base speed. Unless otherwise stated, no action is required, and the roll is made as part of the entity's movement. This follows the "Difficulties and recommended thresholds" as follows.
- Base Thresholds:
  - 4: A steep embankment, ladder, knotted rope, or tree with many branches.
  - 8: A rope or near vertical rock with many big holds and ledges, or average tree.
  - 12: A branchless tree or lamp post or vertical wall with good holds, monkey bars.
  - 16: An slightly overhanging wall with good holds, or vertical wall (eg old brick wall).
  - 24: A steep overhanging wall with holds, or a well masoned town wall.
  - 30: A cave roof, steep overhanging wall with few holds, a perfectly masoned town wall.
  - 36: A ceiling or perfectly smooth glass/metal vertical wall
  - 50: A force wall or flowing waterfall.
- Modifiers:
  - Surface is wet: -5 Penalty.
  - Surface is loose: -5 Penalty.
  - Entity climbs at 1/2 speed or dash: -5 penalty.
  - Entity spends one hour studying the climb: Advantage.
- Special:
  - Entities with a climb speed can always "take care" to climb.
  - A roll of a climber's kit allows to make a climb safe, reducing fall distance to 20ft for threshold 24+ climbs and 10ft for threshold 23- climbs.
  - An entity that fails a climb roll fails to progress on a climb.
  - An entity that fails by 5 or more falls half the distance and suffers the consequences. If this is a critical fail, the entity falls the full distance.
- **Take care**: No. Entities without a cimb speed are always considered at risk when climbing.
- **Try again**: Yes, but repeated fall damage on failure might make repeated attempts undesirable.

__STR: Fortify__

The skill is used for building structures, fortifying positions (dungeon corridors, battle fields, encampments). It is also used for safely demolishing structures and fortifications. Lastly it is used for making a site safe from natural hazards and making it fit for encampment (amelioration). Fortification rolls are usually made against the threshold set by the terrain and weather.
- **Building**: There are special rules for building. They need to be written.
- **Fortification**: It takes 30min per 5ft square to fortify a position.
  - This can give a 3/4 cover bonus to defenders.
  - This can be used to construct a terrain/structure trap (see traps).
  - This can be used to create a barricade (with a break threshold of your roll).
- **Amelioration**: For medium size creature the minum camping area is 5ft x 10ft.
  - It takes 10 minutes to ameliorate this area in threshold 10- terrain.
  - It takes 1h to ameliorate this area in threshold 11+ terrain.
- **Modifiers**:
  - The time can be reduced, but without special or supernatural abilities it cannot be less than 5 minutes.
  - For every size category above medium the total time taken is halved.
  - Multiple entities can participate in the process, in which case the time taken is divided by the number of entities taking part. For each size category above medium, an entity counts as twice as many entities of the next category down. So a largte entity counts as 2 medium entities, but a huge entity counts as 4 medium entities.
  - An entity can do a "rush job" and take half the time: -5 penalty.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes.

__STR: Swim__

Swimming is a separate skill from climbing and overland atheletics. It is used for moving through a liquid medium, such as water, lava, quicksand, or a monster's stomach acid. A creature without a *swim* skill climbs at 1/4 of its base speed. Unless otherwise stated, no action is required, and the roll is made as part of the entity's movement. This follows the "Difficulties and recommended thresholds" as follows.
- Base Thresholds:
  - 4: Float or swim in perfectly calm, warm water, under perfect conditions.
  - 8: To float or swim while engaged in combat.
  - 8: Swim in a direction while under water. 
  - 50: Swim up a flowing waterfall or down an erupting volcano (if you're immune to Fire[Natural]).
- Threshold modifiers:
  - Severe or Extreme currents: +5 or +10 to threshold.
  - Severe or Extreme turbulance/waves: +5 or +10 to threshold.
  - Severe or Extreme temperature: +5 or +10 to threshold.
- Penalties:
  - Wearing medium armour: -5 penalty.
  - Wearing heavy armour: -10 penalty.
  - For every 10lb of carried equipment: -1 penalty.
- Special:
  - Entities with a swim speed can always "take care" to swim.
  - Floation devices (improvised or purpose made) reduce thresholds for staying or returning to the surface by 5.
  - An entity with a diver's kit can see normally in the fluid, can swim at 1/2 base speed instead of 1/4 base speed, and does not need to worry about breath for 30 minutes. Usually a diver's kit is designed specifically for one fluid.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: No. The dynamic nature of failure and drowning makes it meaningless.

__DEX: Acrobatics__

Acrobatics is used for complex dynamic movement and manoeuvres. Unless otherwise stated, no action is required, and the roll is made as part of the entity's movement.
- Substitute for climb if the climb distance is less than the entity's base movement.
  - On a fail the entity automatically falls the full distance.
- Avoid Attacks of Opportunity when moving through a set of threatened squares.
  - Threshold: [Attack Bonus of hostile] + 13.
- Ignore the damage for the first 10ft of a fall.
  - Deliberate fall: Threshold 12.
  - Not deliberate fall: Threshold 16.
- Move over narrow surfaces (adjust accordingly for entity size).:
  - 4: 1-2ft wide.
  - 8: 7-12 inches wide.
  - 12: 2-6 inches wide.
  - 16: Less than 2 inches wide.
- When moving over unstable or slippery surfaces. For threshold, start with 0 and add all modifiers that apply.
  - Slippery or Frictionless surface: +5 or +10.
  - Violent (eg ship in a storm) or extreme movement (eg earthquake or collapse): +5 or +10.
  - Slope (30-45 deg), Steep slope (45+): +2 or +5.
- Entertaining others with a feats of acrobatics or gymnastics (see "Difficulties and recommended thresholds"). This generally represents at least one minute of performance.
- Failure of an acrobatics roll by 5 or more may result in falling. Failure by a lesser margin generally results in lack of progress.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, although the potential of falling often makes it meaningless.

__DEX: Fly__

I don't know whether we even need this as a skill. It is done as part of an entity's or vehicle's movement.
- **Maintain control** of one's trajectory in unfavourable conditions.
  - Threshold = 5 + [1 per 10mph] of wind speed.
  - Small entities start making rolls at 30mph. This increases by +10mph for each size category above "small", and flight category above "average".
- **Regain control** when falling.
  - Threshold = 10 + [turns falling or out of control].
- **Emulate highter flight** category (eg good flyer trying to hover). This is also used for manoeuvres.
  - Threshold = 10 + [5 x number of categories above current category].
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, although the DM can rule that repeated failure results in the "crippled" condition or damage to the vehicle.

__DEX: Heal__

Healing is used to use medical art and science (as opposed to magic) to diagnose and treat injury and illness. It usually takes at least a minute. It is fine to use WIS instead as a governing stat, especially for diagnosis.
- **Stabilise**: As an action, cure the "dying" condition.
  - Threshold = 15
- **First Aid**. As an action, cure "unconcious", or delay the effects of "crippled" or "bleeding" condition for 1 hour.
  - Threshold = 15 if [Natural]
  - Threshold = 25 if [Supernatural]
- **Treat poison**. Requires 1 minute - 1h of treatment:
  - Threshold = Threshold of poison.
- **Treat disease**. Requires 1 minute to 1 hour of treatment. Often requires several successes over consecutive days (see diseases).
  - Threshold = Threshold of disease.
- **Long term care**. Duration varies (at least 8h). Double number of HP regained over a long rest.
  - Threshold = 10 + [number of creatures x 2].
- **Diagnosis**. Diagnose disease, poison or condition.
  - Natural condition: 12
  - Supernatural condition: 20
  - Disease: Threshold of the disease or poison
  - It is usually fine to rule that once an entity has seen it once, it knows what it is.
- **Take care**: Yes, for treatment. No for diagnosis.
- **Try again**: For treatment, yes (although the patient might be dead by then). For diagnos, no.


__DEX: Ride__

An entity riding a mount substitutes uses its move to control its mount and its own seat on it. In return it uses the mount's movement speed and modalities. Using a "run" or "sprint" action requires that a rider also uses their action. In addition rolls can be made to perform certain particular actions.
- **Substitute** for "Athletics" or "Acrobatics" for actions that start or end with the rider on the mount. For example this includes, dancing, jumping and falling.
- **Fight**: As a **communicate** action instruct your mount to make its attack.
  - War trained mount: Threshold = 12.
  - Untrained mount: Threshold = 24.
  - An "aggressive" mount will attack of its own accord, whether you want it to or not.
- **Control**: As a **communicate** action, keep control of your mount in combat.
  - Keep non combat trained mount in combat: Threshold = 24
  - Keep an "aggressive" mount from attacking available targets: Threshold = 16.
  - Control an uncooperative mount that is untrained or does not accept the rider. Threshold = Opposed roll vs Mount's charisma.
- **Stay in saddle**: Keep your seating under adverse circumstances (non-action).
  - Threshold = Threshold of provoking event.
  - On damage over 20, threshold = [damage suffered / 2]
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, where appropriate. For "fight" and "control" the threshold increases by 1 for every failure.


__DEX: Sleight of Hand__

Sleight of hand is not just for "hands". It is the skill combining the use of delicate and precise manipulations with one's body parts and the psychological know-how to make sure that they go unnoticed. It is usually a **main action**. The term "small" is not precise, and common sense should be used.
- **"Steal"**: Take a small unattended item into your possession without being noticed. This should also be used for replacing items or performing "magic" tricks or cheating at cards:
  - Threshold when not observed: 8 (It is possible to fail because one can fail spectacularly enough to still draw attention!)
  - Threshold when actively observed: Opposed vs Perception.
- **"Pick pocket"**: Take a small attended item into your possession without being noticed:
  - Threshold: Opposed vs [Perception (at advantage if entity has a sense of touch)]. 
- **"Liberate item"**: Remove a small jammed item or component of device or structure from where it belongs.
  - 8: Loosely jammed item (eg gem between wardrobe and wall).
  - 12: Tighly jammed item (eg lock of hair stuck in a door).
  - Add +4 to the threshold if the item has adhered.
  - Add +4 to the threshold if fingers (or other body parts) cannot reach.
- **"Liberate"**: Slip free of manacles and the like.
  - Threshold is threshold value of manacles (usually 20-36).
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes, although for "steal" or "pick pocket" the threshold increases by +10 as any observers are likely to be wary this time.

__DEX: Tinker__

Tinkering involves making, modifying and breaking delicate mechanisms, constructions or devices. This includes things like gem cutting, watch making, disabling intricate traps and picking locks. Usually this is either difficult or impossible without additional proficiency with an appropriate kit. Disabling devices carefully usually takes a minute. Modifying them takes at least a minute, while crafting can take hours, days or longer (See Crafting for discussion of this topic).
- **Pick lock or disable trap**:  1 minute.
  - Threshold: Threshold of lock/trap.
  - Rush job (1 round): +10 to threshold.
  - Study: Spending an hour studying the lock/trap reduces threshold by 5.
  - Thresholds of locks generally range 20-36.
  - Thresholds of traps generally range 8-28 (but failure can be lethal).
- **Research device**: Spend time to understand how a device works. This then enables the entity to recreate the device (providing it has the appropriate skills and facilities) or gain a permanent +5 to disabling such devices.
  - Simple device (eg sand clock, thing that goes "dong"): Threshold = 12, time = 1 hour.
  - Average device (eg watermill): Threshold = 16, time = 4h.
  - Complex device (eg pendulum clock, steam engine): Threshold: 24, time = 1 week.
  - Masterpiece/unique mechanism (eg antikythera mechanism): Threshold = 30, time = 1 month.
  - If an entity takes double the time, it can reduce the threshold by -4.
  - If an entity takes wishes to do a rush job and half the time, increase the threshold by +10.
  - Research of complex (and higher) devices can be simplified by using assistants. The assistant must be proficient both in **tinker** and the appropriate tools. For each assistent reduce research time by 1 day, to a maximum of half the time (rounded up).
- **Create device**: Create a device whose general design you know.
  - Threshold: Varies.
- **Modify/sabotage device**: Modify the device to alter its function or cause it to disfunction in a specific manner.
  - Threshold: [Creation threshold + 4]
  - Time taken: Half the time to create the device.
- **Disable device**: Cause the device to stop functioning without causing immediate catastrophic failure.
  - Threshold: [Creation threshold]
  - Time taken: 1 minute for threshold 16 and below. 1 hour for threshold 24 and below. For higher thresholds, the DM should set a reasonable time.
  - An entity may attempt a rush job to reduce the times to 1 round, 1 minute (or ~1/10) by taking a -10 penalty.
- **Take care**: Yes. for "disable", "create" or "modify". No for "research".
- **Try again**: Yes, if it hasn't blown up in your face yet!

__CON: Harvest__

Harvest is the umbrella skill covering the harvesting of natural resources from the environment. This includes, gathering herbs, cutting wood, trapping small game, fishing and mining. For each individual type of harvesting proficiency with the tools is required to use the skill to its full potential. This reflects that each one is a separate discipline and often uses different tools and a different knowledge base.
- **Threshold**: Determined by terrain and weather. (See "Travel rolls and terrain")
- **Guideline yields**:
 - Hunt/trap small prey: 1 small creature per day + 1 per 5 points by which the terrain threshold is exceeded.
 - Strip a carcass (small, medium, large, huge, enormous): (30 min, 2h, 4h, 1d, 1 week). Threshold: (6, 9, 12, 18, 24).
 - Harvest surface plants/minerals: 5-30 min per 5ft. Threshold: Terrain.
 - Harvest subsurface minerals (mining): 1h-1d per 5ft Threshold: Terrain.
- **Modifiers and Special**.
  - If the resource is rare, or exotic increase the threshold by +5 or +10.
  - If the resource cannot be found in the terrain, then the time is spent and the harvest fails.
  - The duration of the "harvesting" and the magnitude of success determine the yield of the harvest. Critical failure results in the damage to the tools used (or HP loss or injury if the tool was the character's body or spirit).
  - Exceeding the threshold by 5 allows to double the yield or half the time. Exceeding by 10 or more, allows both.
- **Take care**: Yes.
- **Try again**: Yes.
