The caster may make a single attack with the weird (15ft reach) as a "main action" on the same turn and on subsequent turns. The weird may also carry out the "grapple" or "shove"/"throw" combat manoeuvres, or make simple interactions with its environment, similar to a 15ft snake. (-3+3+6=4+2)

**Special**: If the target is a square of water or ground, the caster retains control of the weird. If the target is an entity it may make a save to reject the spell, in which case the spell fails.

**Upcast**: Either the damage increases by 1d12, or the reach increases by 5ft for every extra MP dice used. If the MP dice total is 3 or higher, the weird's attack is carried out as a "secondary action".

|Duration|Special: 1h, then permanent (7 days)| + 12
|Concentration|yes (yes)|-3
|Components|kinetic|
|Focus|A wilted leaf of a dead spider|-1
|Save|Con|

**Description**: Call a class C "disease" to afflict the target. Alternatively chose a single stat: The target has disadvantage with all attacks, rolls and saves governed by that stat.

**Special**:
- The target does not get a save at the end of its turns vs this spell.
- If the caster concentrates on the spell to the end of the duration, the target has a second save, and then the spell becomes permanent.
- The spell can also be lifted with any ability that curses diseases.

**Global**: The spell has an affect with a 100ft radius, centered on the spot where it was cast and affects all entities within it. For every 4MP extra, the spell's radius is increased by 100ft or the duration is increased by 7 days.

### Harvest

- If the land is infertile (eg ruins, city, subterranean, desert), the MP is expended and the harvest fails.

**Global**: The radius increases to 100ft per 8MP dice. The amount of sustenance obtained is enough for 200 large (800 medium) mortals per 8MP.

|Casting time|"main action" or "reaction" (2h + 20min per 8MP)|
|Range|60ft|+1
|Duration|12min (1 day)|+3
|Components|kinetic|
|Concentration|local|-3
|Limit|The target has no control over its fly direction or speed|-2 
|Save|Wis|

**Description**: The target is no longer attracted to the earth. This has the following effect:
- Its jump distance is by x4 the base distance of the roll (after that it slows down and stops).
- When jumping upwards it will hang at the maximum height instead of returning to earth.
- When moving at more than than half its speed, the target must make a threshold=20 acrobatics roll or end up hanging mid-air at an altitude of a few feet.
- When airborne as a result of this spell, a target is carried by the wind at half of the wind's speed.

**Special**: The spell can be cast as a reaction when a target begins to fall. If cast as a reaction, the target descends at ~60ft per round. If cast as a main action on a target that is already falling, it begins to decelerate. This does nothing if the fall distance is less than ~360ft. Otherwise, if the fall is long, for every round the spell effects the target it decelerates 20ft per round (from 360ft), decreasing fall damage by 2d12 per round of falling, to an eventual safe speed of 60ft.

**Global**: When cast globally the spell creates a spherical zone centered on the caster where this effect acts. For every 8 extra MP dice added the zone is expanded by 200ft or the duration increased by a day. Every entity that enters the area and does not succeed a Wis save is affected by the spell.

|Save|Wis|

**Description**: The caster creates an illusionary scene which mimics the real scene to all senses except touch and pain. It can do no damage. The scene realistically mimics a real scene, at first glance, but has no material substance. For example:
- An illusionary bridge over a river will hold no weight, but if a rock is thrown against might show the rock bouncing a few steps along the bridge and coming to rest on it (in the meanwhile the real rock passes straight through it).
- An illusionary bonfire would feel warm at a distance, but would fail to melt a block of ice at some distance (although if the ice is placed inside of the area of the "mirage" it would *appear* to melt).

An illusion can be broken in the following manner:
- At a distance, when interacting with the illusion from outside of it, an entity may attempt to disbelieve, and roll a Wis save at disadvantage against the caster's threshold.
- When interacting with the "mirage" from inside it, it may attempt disbelieve it and roll a Wis save against the caster's threshold.
- When an entity interacts with the "mirage" in such a way that the "mirage" seems implausible or suspicious (eg a bonfire failing to melt a block of ice, or the target falling through the bridge), it may roll a Wis save at advantage.
- If the entity has some magic sense, it makes a Wis save against the "mirage" as soon as it detects it.
- If the entity has "true seeing" it automatically sees through the "mirage"

**Upcast**: For every extra MP, the duration increases by 12 min or the radius increases by 5ft.

**Global**: The mirage lasts for a day and has a radius of 400ft. For every 4 extra MP the mirage lasts for an extra day or its radius increases by 400ft.

When first entering, or starting a turn in the storm, all entities must make a Str save to avoid being blown prone by the winds and a Dex save to avoid lightning strikes (no damage on successful save). In addition the high winds make vocal communication impossible, making the entity essentially "deaf". The winds are classed as "extreme".

**Upcast**: For every extra MP dice, either the radius of the storm increases by 5ft, the duration increases by 1 min or the lightning damage increases by 1d8.

**Global**: The spell affects a large area and lasts for an hour. The winds are classed as "severe". For every extra 4MP dice, either the area increases by 100ft, or the duration increases by 1h. If at least 24MP dice are used in the casting, the wind effects are "extreme".
