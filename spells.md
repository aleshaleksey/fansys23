# Spells

## Spellcasting basics

Spells are a subset of supernatural powers that mortals have learned to channel by following certain procedures. Entities that cast spells are referred to here as "**casters**". Spells can be either "**local**" or "**global**". Spells  ALWAYS involve a combination of one or more of the following:

___
### Casting spells and components

Spells can be viewed as recipes or instructions for calling forth supernatural forces. They are generally at least somewhat fixed in their formulation and procedure and have the following components.

1. **Kinetic Components**: A set of defined, obvious gestures or movements. An "immobilised" or "restrained" caster cannot perform these. (conditions that imply "immobilised" fall under this category). Spells with somatic components provoke attacks of opportunity.
2. **Incantation components**: A set of defined, well enunciated words or sounds. A "silenced" or "silent" caster cannot perform these. (conditions that imply inability to produce defined sound fall under this category).
3. **Ritual components**: A ritual is a procedure involving defined movement and positioning of objects or entities, or the creation of defined patterns. Disruption of this procedure ruins the ritual. Rituals typically apply to global spells.

As a consequence, a caster who is "restrained" or "immobilised" cannot cast spells with somatic components and a caster who is "aphonic" or "silenced" cannot cast spells with incantation components.

___
### Spell ranges

Spell ranges are designated as "**close**" or "**ranged**".
1. A "**close**" spell, like a melee attack requires direct contact between caster and target. Its range is the caster's reach.
2. A "**ranged**" spell can have a range of 5ft or higher. It is designated as eg "ranged[60ft]". The base distances are 15ft, 30ft, 60ft, 120ft, 240ft, although spells with greater ranges, especially in the "global" category exist. Global spell ranges can be hundreds of miles or more.

___
### General casting rules

There are a number of general rules pertaining to spellcasting.
1. An entity can only cast ONE spell at a time. If it attempts to cast a second, either both spells dissipate, or the casting ends in spectacular failure. For example trying to cast "Fire Shield" (local) while casting "Resurrection" (global), will result in failure. 
2. Spells are never truly permanent in the material realm and can be **broken**, **counterspelled**, and **dispelled**. Entities summoned through spells can be **banished**.
3. Casting "ranged" spells with somatic components in melee provokes attacks of opportunity.

___
### Concentration

Spells with an active effect (eg summoning) and non-instantaneous duration usually require the caster to maintain their existence by "**concentrating**" on them. Usually this refers to "local" spells, but some "global" spells also require concentration. This mechanic exists mainly to reduce some of the unbalanced nonsense found in certain other systems. Concentration has the following rules:
1. A caster can NEVER concentrate on more than one spell.
2. If concentration is broken, the spell dissipates or fails spectacularly. Either way its effects end.
3. An "incapacitated" (or so implied) entity cannot concentrate.
4. Concentration can be disrupted by taking damage (threshold = 10 or 1/2 damage taken, whichever is higher).
5. Concentration can be disrupted by violent movement (threshold = 12), violent weather (threshold 12 = 10) or both (threshold = 16).
6. A caster can "hold" an "instantaneous" spell with a release trigger to trigger the effect within a minute of casting. The threshold = 8 +[rounds held]. If the trigger is not met the spell dissipates. The cost of the spell is paid when the spell is cast (always), not when it is triggered.

___
### Identifying and Manipulating spells

Spells can be identified while they are being cast by the "[Knowledge:Arcana](skills.md#knowledge)" skill. This is usually a non-action. "[Spellworking](skills.md#spellworking)" is used for interfacing with spells, magical effects, and devices. This generally takes between 1 minute and 1 week.

___
### Banishing, Breaking, Counter-spelling and Dispelling

"**Counter-spelling**" is interfering with the casting of a local spell through magical means, hence causing it fail. "**Dispelling**" is the permanent removal of a local spell through magical means. "**Banishing**" is the dismissal of summoned entities to whence they came. "**Breaking**" is the permanent removal of a global spell either by meeting its ending condition, use of spellworking or exceptionally powerful local magic.

**Counter-spelling**: Any spellcaster with at least 9 MP dice total can counter-spell. You can only counter-spell magics from the same or opposite type (see table above). In order to counter-spell, you must be within 10ft x [MP dice] being used to counter-spell of the target caster. Counter-spelling magics of the same type is done at disadvantage. The steps are as follows:
1. Declare "preparing to counter-spell" on your turn and use your "secondary action" to watch for spellcasters. Declare the number of MP dice you are preparing for this (minimum of 3).
2. When a spell is cast, identify that it is with a "knowledge:arcana" roll.
3. If the spell belongs to the same type or opposite type of local magic, use your reaction and declare "counter-spell".
4. Pay the declared MP dice cost.
5. Roll a SAP (Nat + Base + Wis) roll vs their SAT (Nat + Base + Wis). You have a bonus (or penalty if it's less) to the roll equal to the difference in MP dice used by the two sides. If it is the same type of magic, your roll is at disadvantage. If it is neither the same or opposite, you cannot counter-spell it.
6. If you meet or beat the threshold, the spell fails (maybe even catastrophically).

**Dispelling**: Any spellcaster with at least 11 MP dice total can dispel. You can only dispel magics of a type that you are capable of casting. In order to dispel you must be within 10ft x [MP dice] being used to dispel the effect of the effect and you must be able to see it or to experience it. Thus you must either have senses that can detect it (eg using "See Spell" or "See Unseen") or you must enter the area of effect. The steps for dispelling are as follows:
1. Identify the spell using "knowledge:arcana".
2. Declare "dispel" as a "main action" and how many MP dice you are using to dispel.
3. Pay the declared MP dice cost.
4. Roll a SAP (Nat + Base + Wis) roll vs their SAT (Nat + Base + Wis). You have a bonus (or penalty if it's less) to the roll equal to the difference in MP dice used by the two sides. If you are within the area of the spell's effect, or are its target, you have advantage on the roll.
5. If you succeed on the roll, the spell ends, if you do not, it persists.

**Banishing**: Summoned entities are not dispelled in the same way as spells. There are two ways of dealing with them.
1. Dispelling as normal, but only by casters who have spells with the "summon" descriptor or the "Bind Familiar" or "Bind Beast" ability.
2. By a "spellworking" roll to "disimbue" the summon, but only after the effect has been identified by "knowledge:arcana".

**Breaking**: A global spell can be broken by one of two modes: The first is use of "spellworking" by the "disable supernatural trap rules. This is less effective for spells with the "curse" descriptor (disadvantage). "Curses" have a "break condition": A condition under which they lose their power. After this happens 'spellworking" rolls to break curses are made at advantage.

___
### The catastrophic cascade

Sometimes, when interaction with a spell or magical effect, it fails. Under certain conditions it fails catastrophically. This is known as"Global" spells can be useful, and indeed devastating in combat, but most combat spells are "local". "spectacular failure" or the "catastrophic cascade".

**Catastrophic cascade on casting two spells**: If a caster tries to cast two spells at the same time, the process fails. If the instantaneous total MP dice of the two spells was greater than the permitted local maximum the caster must roll a Cha save vs the MP dice total + 13 that was used. On failure the spellcaster takes [MP dice total of spells] x d6 light damage. Entities within 10ft may make a Dex save for half damage. Beware of exploding mages.

**Catastrophic cascade when concentration is broken**: If a caster's concentration is broken, the spell dissipates and its effects end. If the number of MP dice used for a local spell is equal to the maximum permitted (1/3 of the caster's MP dice total), the caster must roll a Cha save vs the MP dice total that was used. On failure the spellcaster takes [MP dice total of spells] x d6 light damage. Entities within 10ft may make a Dex save for half damage. Beware of exploding mages.

**Catastrophic cascade on counter-spelling**: If a counter-speller's counter-spell roll exactly equals a caster's [SAT] (Nat + Base + Wis + 13), and the number of MP dice expended for the spell and counter-spell are equal a catastrophic cascade is triggered. All entities and structures within 10ft of the half-way point between the two casters take [the combined MP dice used] x d6 of "pressure" damage. The threshold = 18. Beware of exploding mages.

**Other modes of spectacular failure**: Failing a "spellworking" roll when interacting with powerful magics, especially when disimbuing, can lead to spectacular failure. Further information is found in the "[spellworking](skills.md#spellworking)" rules. 

___
 
### Global and local spells

Spells can either be "local" or "global" in scope. This helps distinguish spells that are quick to cast and have a short and immediate effect, and grand spells which require a long time to cast and often have very wide reaching effects.

"**Local**" spells have the following properties:

- They generally take between a couple of seconds to a dozen minutes to cast ("minor action" to "10 minutes"), but generally take a "main action".
- Their effect is either immediate, or lasts no longer than a few days.
- Their effect has a range of no more than a mile of a caster.
- Their effect has a radius of no more than a mile (eg. search spells) or 108ft (eg. explosion magic).
- They take 1-10 MP dice to cast, although more MP can assigned (up to 1/3 of a caster's MP dice).
 
"**Global**" spells have the following properties:

- Generally take a dozen minutes to a month to cast, but more often an hour or a day.
- Their effect can be immediate and devastating, or can last for centuries (eg Great Barrier spells).
- Their range can be hundreds of miles (but is often much shorter).
- Their effect radius can be hundreds of miles, but is more often localised (eg a Mage's Sanctum).
- They take at least 3 MP dice per day to cast, with the usual cost being ~20 dice per day.

Many "local" spells can also be cast as global spells. In this case the parameters of the global casting are are indicated in brackets after the parameters of the local casting.

___
### Learning spells and mental capacity

#### Spells known and spells ready

A character can know any number of spells. However, a character can only have a limited number of spells ready. A character decides last thing before sleeping which spells to bring ready for the next day. The number of spells a character can ready [Int + [MP dice total] / 2] spells at any one time. The first ten "MP 0 spells" do not count against this limit.

#### Spells gained from levels in "spellcasting" ability

Characters learn a few spells every time they gain a level in one of the "Spellcasting" abilities. A character can also learn spells by independent study, apprenticeship or gifting. As a rule, elemental and natural spellcasting grant more spells on learning the ability, but are harder to learn outside of that. On the other hand kinetic and incantation spellcasting grants fewer spells, but allows extra spells to be learned more easily.

#### learning spells through independent study or from a mentor.

The base time to learn a spell through personal research is 108 days per MP dice cost of a spell (for global spells this is the "per day" cost). A character with access to suitable environment and resources may use academics to reduce the time (see "[Academics](skills.md#academics)"). The rate per MP dice become (108 - ["academics" roll]) to a minimum of 64 days per MP dice. For higher level spells, independent research is incredibly time consuming, and a sage might have spent a lifetime to uncover a single new global spell.

The more common way to learn spells is to learn from an entity that already has the spell, a mentor so to speak. If you are learning from a mentor, the process is a lot faster, as you are transferring skills and knowledge that already exists, as opposed to unearthing new spells. For elemental and nature spells the base rate is 108 hours per MP dice cost of a spell. For incantation and kinetic spells the base rate is 64 hours. This time can be reduced with a "academics" roll from the "apprentice" and a "knowledge:arcana" roll from the mentor. The final time cost per MP dice cost is [base rate - ["academics" roll] - ["arcana" roll]]. Regardless of the result, this cost cannot be reduced to lower than 20 hours (aka 2 days) per MP dice cost for elemental and nature magic, or 10 hours (aka 1 day) per 2 MP dice cost for incantation and kinetic magic.

#### Spell transfer

Certain spells, such as "Isolate Essence", "Memory Thief" and "Imbue Essence" allow knowledge, skills and spells to be almost instantaneously between entities. However these spells carry a high cost. More importantly, the entity imparting the spell loses it from their spells known, and there are few who would agree to such a transfer without a steep cost.

#### MP 0 spells

These spells use so little energy to cast, that they do not use MP. Casting them does not cause exertion. For the sake learning spells they count as taking half as long as spells that cost 1 MP dice. These spells are so simple that the first ten of these do not count against readied spell limit. MP 0 spells ALWAYS have a base casting time of "main action".

___
## The 6 types of magic

Beyond "local" and "global" spells are divided into 6 types:

+ Elemental: Air
+ Elemental: Earth
+ Elemental: Fire
+ Elemental: Ice
+ Incantation
+ Kinetic
+ Nature

Element and nature magic is "domain" based, and the the spells that fall into these magics are associated with a domain. Incantation and kinetic magic is "method" based, and are distinguished by how a spell is cast. A specialist spellcaster often learns between two and four types of magic to some level of proficiency. Spell-swords on the other hand will often get away with one or two.

### Elemental (Air)

Spells of this type are associated with elemental air. All and any spells with the "air" descriptor are on this spell list. They are associated with the "shear" and "lighting" damage types and "paralysed", "stunned", "prone" and "crippled" conditions.They are often used for travel, gathering information and controlling weather, but also have combat uses.

For every level of Spellcasting: Elemental(Air), a character learns 2 compatible spells. On taking Elemental(Earth) I a character also gains 2 MP zero spells of the "air" descriptor.

### Elemental (Earth)

Spells of this type are associated with elemental earth. All and any spells with the "earth" descriptor are on this spell list. They are associated with all physical damage types and the "restrained", "grappled", "prone", "crippled", and "bleeding" conditions. It is generally used for fortification and agriculture. At the first level it learns 3 zero-level spells.

For every level of Spellcasting: Elemental(Air), a character learns 2 compatible spells. On taking Elemental(Earth) I a character also gains 2 MP zero spells of the "earth" descriptor.

### Elemental (Fire)

Spells of this type are associated with elemental fire. All and any spells with the "fire" descriptor are on this spell list. They are associate with "fire" damage and the "incapacitated", "catatonic", "frightened" and "blinded". It is often used in cooking, smelting and similar disciplines, as well as  and of course warfare.

For every level of Spellcasting: Elemental(Fire), a character learns 2 compatible spells. On taking Elemental(Fire) I a character also gains 2 MP zero spells of the "fire" descriptor.

### Elemental (Ice)

Spells of this type are associated with elemental water and ice. All and any spells with the "water" and "ice" descriptors are on this spell list. They are associated with "ice", "piercing" and "pressure" damage. It is typically used in seaborne travel and agriculture.

For every level of Spellcasting: Elemental(Ice), a character learns 2 compatible spells.  On taking Elemental(Ice) I a character also gains 2 MP zero spells of the "ice" descriptor.

### Incantation

Incantation magic covers a wide range of spells whose effects are activated by song or chant. Incantation magic covers all spells with an incantation component. Spells cast through incantation spellcasting cannot be affect by "aphonic spell". Typically summoning spells and close combat spells are compatible with incantation magic.

For every level of Spellcasting: Incantation, a character learns 1 compatible spells. On taking Incantation I a character also gains 3 compatible MP zero spells.

### Kinetic

Kinetic magic covers a wide range of spells whose effects are activated by song or chant. Kinetic magic covers all spells with a kinetic component. Spells cast through kinetic spellcasting cannot be affected by "stilled spell". Kinetic components seem to increase the potence of a spell, therefore spells which are not constrained by other considerations (eg close combat spells), tend to use kinetic components and be compatible with this type of magic.

For every level of Spellcasting: Kinetic, a character learns 1 compatible spell. On taking Kinetic I a character also gains 3 compatible MP zero spells.

### Nature

Nature magic covers all nature related spells. All spells of "winter", "spring", "summer", "autumn" and "seasonal" fall within this category. They are not associated with any particular damage type or condition. It is used in any sphere associated with nature. Unlike other types of spellcasting, nature magic does not have an opposite spell type. 

For every level of Spellcasting: Nature, a character learns 2 compatible spell. On taking Nature I a character also gains 2 compatible MP zero spells.

## Spell List

### Spell Descriptors

A descriptor tells you something about the nature of the spell. This can include the element or force it is associated with, its purpose and its creator.

#### Descriptors table

|Descriptor class| Descriptor|
|-|-|
|Element|Air, Earth, Fire, Ice|
|Energy|Fire, Ice, Lightning, Light|
|Purpose|Barrier, Curse, Healing, Travel, Destruction|
|Season|Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn|
|Origin|Nature, Mortal, Divine, Profane, Spiritual|

### Spell cards

Spells are by their nature quite varied and cause various effects. This means that the rules and description for each one should be clearly stated and explained. Spells are laid out as "spell cards". Below is an explanation and description:

|parameter|description|example|
|-|-|-|
|Name|The name and descriptors of the spell|Wind Walk [Air, Nature, Travel]|
|Scope|The scope and descriptors of a spell|Local/Global|
|MP|The minimum MP dice cost of the spell|3 (12)|
|Target(s)|The number of entities it affects|1+|
|Casting time|The time needed to cast the spell|"main action" (1 hour)|
|Range|How far the caster must be from the caster|5ft|
|Duration|Duration of spell, or maximum duration if concentration spell|10 min+ (1 day+)|
|Components|What bodily components are needed to cast the spell|incantation (+ritual)|
|Materials|What consumable materials are needed for the spell|None (12 dandelion heads)|
|Focus|What spell focus, or material that is not consumed is needed|None|
|Condition|Any special conditions that must be fulfilled to successfully cast|target cannot be earth aligned|
|Save|What save is needed , if any, and what happens on a success|Wis (harmless), no effect|
|Attack|What the governing attribute for the attack is, if any (usually Wis)|-|
|Damage|Damage done if any|-|
|Healing|Healing done if any|-|
|Conditions|Conditions caused if any|-|
|Description|A more detailed description of the spell and any peculiarities|Blah blah blah|

"Materials", "focus", "conditions", "damage", "healing", "save", "attack" and "conditions" may be omitted if the spell if they are not applicable to the spell, and if they are not given in the spell card, then none is caused.

The clean example would look like:

|||
|-|-|
|Name|Wind Walk [Air, Nature, Travel]|
|Scope|Local (Global)|
|MP|3 (12)|
|Target(s)|1+|
|Casting time|"main action" (1h + 20 min/4MP)|
|Range|Close|
|Duration|12 min+ (1 day+)|
|Components|incantation (+ritual)|
|Materials|None (12 dandelion heads)|
|Condition|target cannot be earth aligned|
|Save|Wis (harmless), no effect|

**Description**: The target gains a good fly speed equal to your walking speed, as if walking upon the air. When the spell ends, the target loses this movement modality immediately.

For every extra MP point (4, if casting globally) placed in the spell you can add either: 1. An extra target, 2. an extra 6 minutes of effect (6h if cast globally).

___
## Rules for making spells

More powerful spells have a higher MP dice cost, weaker spells have a lower MP dice cost. Spell power and utility can also be tweaked by adjusting the cost and availability of materials and foci, as well as changing the duration of casting. To be systematic in this development, there should be clear rules on how to calculate the cost, duration, components etc. of a spell. On the other hand, this is unlikely to be an exact science, since the power of a spell is determined to a large degree by circumstances and player creativity. Thus any such system should be well thought out and flexible. Ultimately the cost of a spell should correlate perfectly with its agency. Where:

Agency = [probability that the spell is useful in a situation] x [how strongly it affects outcome]
