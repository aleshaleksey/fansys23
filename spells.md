# Spells

## Spellcasting basics

Spells are a subset of supernatural powers that mortals have learned to channel by following certain procedures. Entities that cast spells are referred to here as "**casters**". Spells can be either "**local**" or "**global**". Spells  ALWAYS involve a combination of one or more of the following:

___
### Casting spells and components

Spells can be viewed as recipes or instructions for calling forth supernatural forces. They are generally at least somewhat fixed in their formulation and procedure and have the following components.

1. **Somatic Components**: A set of defined, obvious gestures or movements. An "immobilised" or "restrained" caster cannot perform these. (conditions that imply "immobilised" fall under this category). Spells with somatic components provoke attacks of opportunity.
2. **Incantation components**: A set of defined, well enunciated words or sounds. A "silenced" or "silent" caster cannot perform these. (conditions that imply inability to produce defined sound fall under this category).
3. **Ritual components**: A ritual is a procedure involving defined movement and positioning of objects or entities, or the creation of defined patterns. Disruption of this procedure ruins the ritual. Rituals typically apply to global spells.

As a consequence, a caster who is "restrained" or "immobilised" cannot cast spells with somatic components and a caster who is "aphonic" or "silenced" cannot cast spells with incantation components.

___
### Spell ranges

Spell ranges are designated as "**close**" or "**ranged**".
1. A "**close**" spell, like a melee attack must requires direct contact between caster and target. Its range is the caster's reach.
2. A "**ranged**" spell can have a range of 5ft or higher. It is designated as eg "ranged[60ft]". The base distances are 15ft, 30ft, 60ft, 120ft, 240ft, although spells with greater ranges, especially in the "global" category exist. Global spell ranges can be hundreds of miles or more.

___
### General casting rules

There are a number of general rules pertaining to spellcasting.
1. An entity can only cast ONE spell at a time. If it attempts to cast a second, either both spells dissipate, or the casting ends in spectacular failure. For example trying to cast "Fire Shield" (local) while casting "Resurrection" (global), will result in failure. 
2. Spells are never truly permanent in the material realm and can be **broken**, **counterspelled**, and **dispelled**. Entities summoned through spells can be **banished**.
3. Casting "ranged" spells with somatic components provokes attacks of opportunity.

___
### Concentration

Spells with an active effect (eg summoning) and non-instantaneous duration usually require the caster to maintain their existence by "**concentrating**" on them. Usually this refers to "local" spells, but some "global" spells also require concentration. This mechanic exists mainly to reduce some of the unbalanced nonsense found in certain other systems. Concentration has the following rules:
1. A caster can NEVER concentrate on more than one spell.
2. If concentration is broken, the spell dissipates or fails spectacularly. Either way its effects end.
3. An "incapacitated" (or so implied) entity cannot concentrate.
4. Concentration can be disrupted by taking damage (threshold = 10 or 1/2 damage taken, whichever is higher).
5. Concentration can be disrupted by violent movement (threshold = 12), violent weather (threshold 12 = 10) or both (threshold = 16).
6. A caster can "hold" an "instantaneous" spell with a release trigger to trigger the effect within a minute of casting. The threshold = 8 +[rounds held]. If the trigger is not met the spell dissipates. The cost of the spell is paid when the spell is cast (always), not when it is triggered.

### Identifying and Manipulating spells

Spells can be identified while they are being cast by the "[Knowledge:Arcana](skills.md#knowledge)" skill. This is usually a non-action. "[Spellworking](skills.md#spellworking)" is used for interfacing with spells, magical effects, and devices. This generally takes between 1 minute and 1 week.

___
### Banishing, Breaking, Counterspelling and Dispelling

"**Counterspelling**" is interfering with the casting of a local spell through magical means, hence causing it fail. "**Dispelling**" is the permanent removal of a local spell through magical means. "**Banishing**" is the dismissal of summoned entities to whence they came. "**Breaking**" is the permanent removal of a global spell either by meeting its ending condition, use of spellworking or exceptionally powerful local magic.

**Counterspelling**: Any spellcaster with at least 9 MP dice total can counterspell. You can only counterspell magics from the same or opposite type (see table below). In order to counterspell, you must be within 10ft x [MP dice] being used to counterspell of the target caster. Counterspelling magics of the same type is done at disadvantage. The steps are as follows:
1. Declare "preparing to counterspell" on your turn and use your "secondary action" to watch for spellcasters. Declare the number of MP dice you are preparing for this (minimum of 3).
2. When a spell is cast, identify that it is with a "knowledge:arcana" roll.
3. If the spell belongs to the same type or opposite type of local magic, use your reaction and declare "counterspell".
4. Pay the declared MP dice cost.
5. Roll a SAP (Nat + Base + Wis) roll vs their SAT (Nat + Base + Wis). You have a bonus (or penalty if it's less) to the roll equal to the difference in MP dice used by the two sides. If it is the same type of magic, your roll is at disadvantage. If it is neither the same or opposite, you cannot counterspell it.
6. If you meet or beat the threshold, the spell fails (maybe even catastrophically).

**Dispelling**: Any spellcaster with at least 11 MP dice total can dispel. You can only dispel magics of a type that you are capable of casting. In order to dispel you must be within 10ft x [MP dice] being used to dispel the effect of the effect and you must be able to see it or to experience it. Thus you must either have senses that can detect it (eg using "See Spell" or "See Unseen") or you must enter the area of effect. The steps for dispelling are as follows:
1. Identify the spell using "knowledge:arcana".
2. Declare "dispel" as a "main action" and how many MP dice you are using to dispel.
3. Pay the declared MP dice cost.
4. Roll a SAP (Nat + Base + Wis) roll vs their SAT (Nat + Base + Wis). You have a bonus (or penalty if it's less) to the roll equal to the difference in MP dice used by the two sides. If you are within the area of the spell's effect, or are its target, you have advantage on the roll.
5. If you succeed on the roll, the spell ends, if you do not, it persists.

___
### The catastrophic cascade

Sometimes, when interaction with a spell or magical effect, it fails. Under certain conditions it fails catastrophically. This is known as "spectacular failure" or the "catastrophic cascade".

**Catastrophic cascade on casting two spells**: If a caster tries to cast two spells at the same time, the process fails. If the instantaneous total MP dice of the two spells was greater than the permitted local maximum the caster must roll a Cha save vs the MP dice total that was used. On failure the spellcaster takes [MP dice total of spells] x d6 light damage. Entities within 10ft may make a Dex save for half damage. Beware of exploding mages.

**Catastrophic cascade when concentration is broken**: If a caster's concentration is broken, the spell dissipates and its effects end. If the number of MP dice used for a local spell is equal to the maximum permitted (1/3 of the caster's MP dice total), the caster must roll a Cha save vs the MP dice total that was used. On failure the spellcaster takes [MP dice total of spells] x d6 light damage. Entities within 10ft may make a Dex save for half damage. Beware of exploding mages.

**Catastrophic cascade on counterspelling**: If a counterspeller's counterspell roll exactly equals a caster's [SAT] (Nat + Base + Wis + 13), and the number of MP dice expended for the spell and counterspell are equal a catastrphic cascade is triggered. All entities and structures within 10ft of the half-way point between the two casters take [the combined MP dice used] x d6 of "pressure" damage. The threshold = 18. Beware of exploding mages.

**Other modes of spectacular failure**: Failing a "spellworking" roll when interacting with powerful magics, especially when disimbuing, can lead to spectacular failure. Further information is found in the "[spellworking](skills.md#spellworking)" rules.

 "Global" spells can be useful, and indeed devastating in combat, but most combat spells are "local". "**Local**" spells have the following properties:

- They generally take between a couple of seconds to a dozen minutes to cast ("minor action" to "10 minutes"), but generally take a "main action".
- Their effect is either immediate, or lasts no longer than a few days.
- Their effect has a range of no more than a mile of a caster.
- Their effect has a radius of no more than a mile (eg. search spells) or 108ft (eg. explosion magic).
- They take 1-10 MP dice to cast, although more MP can assigned (up to 1/3 of a caster's MP dice).
 
"**Global**" spells have the following properties:

- Generally take a dozen minutes to a month to cast, but more often an hour or a day.
- Their effect can be immediate and devastating, or can last for centuries (eg Great Barrier spells).
- Their range can be hundreds of miles (but is often much shorter).
- Their effect radius can be hundreds of miles, but is more often localised (eg a Mage's Sanctum).
- They take at least 3 MP dice per day to cast, with the usual cost being ~20 dice per day.
