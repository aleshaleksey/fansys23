Fantasy System (FanSys) / New System for Fantasy Worlds (NSFW)
==============================================================

About
-----

This system, (provisional name FanSys/NSFW) is an open fantasy gaming
system for table top fantasy roleplaying games, inspired by d20 systems
like PF v\`, DnD 3.5 and 5e, but designed with balance in mind and using
2d12 as the core role.

The system is designed around a `Constitution <constitution.md>`__,
which is half way between an actual constitution and a design document.
It sets the out the aims of the system, the general principles of the
rules and the commandments for making new rules and content. This should
hopefully prevent half-elves and reborn dhampire faeries, amongst other
horrors of poor game design.

The system is designed to provide a relatively high level of complexity
at character creation time, while keeping the intent that “outcomes are
decided mostly at play time, not creation time”.

Recommended starting point
--------------------------

The `“Quick Start” <01-quick-start.html>`__ should be enough to get an
idea of the system.

To play it is probably also necessary to read `“Movement and
Exploration” <03-movement-exploration.html>`__ and
`“Combat” <04-combat.html>`__. For character creation
`“Skills” <05-skills.html>`__, `“Abilities” <06-abilities.html>`__ and the
first bit of `“Spellcasting” <07-magic-and-spellcasting.html>`__ are also important.

Of course play will be “clunky” if there isn’t at least one person at
the table who knows the system properly.

Version
-------

The version currently stands at:

**v0.0.18**

This is the 18th draft. It is is mostly workable, but needs more
testing, more monsters, and a better layout for clarity.

TODO
----

- Test the abilities and spells more thoroughly.
- Add magic items to equipment list.
- More monster/NPC stat blocks.
- Playtesting and analysis of balance.
