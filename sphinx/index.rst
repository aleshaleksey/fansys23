Fantasy System (FanSys) / New System for Fantasy Worlds (NSFW)
==============================================================

About
-----

FanSys/NSFW is a an open fantasy gaming system for table top roleplaying games. Its core features are:

- 2d12 as the core roll.
- A "rules before rulings" approach to running the game.
- A class-free, ability/skill based level system.
- A distinction between real injury (HP damage) and "soft" damage (MP/SP damage).
- A martial combat system that makes actions and manoeuvres beyond "I hit it", viable.
- A focus on the dichotomy between natural and supernatural phenomena.

It is the game system made because we wanted to play it, not because we wanted to "sell" it.

Recommended starting point
--------------------------

The `“Quick Start” <01-quick-start.html>`__ should be enough to get an
idea of the system.

To play it is probably also necessary to read `“Movement and
Exploration” <03-movement-exploration.html>`__ and
`“Combat” <04-combat.html>`__. For character creation
`“Skills” <05-skills.html>`__, `“Abilities” <06-abilities.html>`__ and the
first bit of `“Spellcasting” <07-magic-and-spellcasting.html>`__ are also important.

Of course play will be “clunky” if there isn’t at least one person at
the table who knows the system properly.

About the Design of FanSys
--------------------------

FanSys/NSFW is an open fantasy gaming system for table top fantasy roleplaying games,
inspired to a degree by d20 systems such as PF v1, DnD 3.5 and 5e, but designed with
balance in mind and using 2d12 as the core roll.

The design of FanSys is guided by a so called `Constitution <constitution.html>`__, which sets
the out the aims of the system, the general principles of the rules and the commandments
for making new rules and content. This should hopefully prevent half-elves and reborn
dhampire faeries, amongst other horrors of poor game design.

FanSys is designed to provide a relatively high level of complexity at character creation time,
while keeping the intent that "outcomes are decided mostly at play time, not creation time".

Version
-------

FanSys is currently a draft set of rules that is quite close to its final form.
Nevertheless, the online rules show the very latest "experimental" rules,
with previous "snapshots"/versions being kept on the FanSys github
(https://github.com/aleshaleksey/fansys23), and will continue to be hosted
there for the foreseeable future.

The aim is to reach **v0.1.0**, at which point the rules will become more or
less fixed, with the exception of errata which will hopefully be few and far between.

The version currently stands at:

**v0.0.18+**

Fantasy Committee
-----------------

There is no dusty cabinet for those of us who dream in the dusty recesses of our mind.
However, all those who contributed to the project one way or another, and did not
wish to remain hidden, are listed in the `Fantasy Committee <fantasy-committee.html>`__.


TODO
----

- Test the abilities and spells more thoroughly.
- Add magic items to equipment list.
- More monster/NPC stat blocks.
- Playtesting and analysis of balance.
