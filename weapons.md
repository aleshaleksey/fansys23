# Weapons and armour

Weapon rules here are based on DnD 3.5, DnD 5e and Pathfinder weapons rules.

## Weapons
Weapons are tools that increase the lethality of martial combatants. For the sake of most abilities other than "sunder", unarmed techniques count as weapons. Each type of weapon requires its own proficiency. The following categories and types of weapons exist:

- **Unarmed combat**
  - Strikes
  - Throws
  - Grapples
  - Disarms
- **Melee**
  - Heavy blades
  - Axes
  - Percussive
  - Pole-arms
  - Staves
- **Melee/Thrown**
  - Light/Thrown blades
  - Spears/Javelins
- **Ranged**
  - Bows
  - Mechanical bows
  - Slings
  - Firearms (optional)
- **Heavy**
  - Ballistae
  - Trebuchet/catapults
  - Canons

### Weapon durability

As other objects, weapons have HP and can be broken, either by misuse, bad dice luck or abilities similar to "sunder". When a weapon's HP reaches 0, it is broken and cannot be used until repaired (more precisely it can be used, but counts as Unarmed:Strike).

### Range increments

It is harder to hit and hit effectively with a ranged weapon at greater distances. This is reflected by the range increment. Not all ranged weapons have the same size or number of ranged increments, reflecting that while some weapons might have a higher absolute range, they do not perform as well at long ranges (harder to aim, loss of projectile speed, etc).

### Weapon properties

Weapons come in all shapes and sizes. They can be made of various materials. As a result they have various properties as follows:

- **Delicate**: On a critical miss, the weapon takes 1 point of damage.
- **Unwieldy**: Unwieldy weapons cannot be easily used in small spaces, where any dimension (width or height or length) are 5ft or less, or when mounted. In those conditions these weapons are wielded at disadvantage.
- **Heavy**: This kind of weapon is "unwieldy". A heavy weapon of the correct size category must be wielded in two hands or it counts as an improvised weapon. In addition they grant a +2 on all basic martial manoeuvres.
- **Reach**: This weapon is "unwieldy", but it does have a range of 10ft.
- **Long**: These weapons are not quite reach weapons, but they are bit longer than usual. A long weapon allows a wielder to use its "secondary action" to lunge and extend its reach to 10ft for a single attack.
- **Light**: -2 when on the receiving end of "sunder" and "disarm" manoeuvres. Its users have advantage when using stealth to conceal this kind of weapon.
- **Mounted**: This weapon was made with mounted combat in mind. If normally there would be penalties for using this kind of weapon mounted, they are negated.
- **Disarm**: Proficiency with this weapon allows the use of disarm as if proficient with the manoeuvre while wielding it.
- **Grapple**: Proficiency with this weapon allows the use of grapple as if proficient with the manoeuvre while wielding it.
- **Throw**: Proficiency with this weapon allows the use of throw as if proficient with the manoeuvre while wielding it.
- **Sunder**: Proficiency with this weapon allows the use of sunder as if proficient with the manoeuvre while wielding it.

### Weapon proficiencies

Any entity may wield a weapon it is physically capably of wielding. If it is not proficient, it makes attacks with a -5 penalty. On a critical fail it damages itself, rolling the same damage dice it would as if it had hit the intended target.

Proficiency with a weapon type eliminates both the penalty and the damage to self on crit fails. In addition it allows the use of any of a weapon's special properties.

### Unarmed Combat

Unarmed combat is the use of one's own body to effectively neutralise targets. In a mundane world this is not particularly effective on the battle field, but can be used effectively in offensively and defensively in other situations, especially when weapons are not available. In a world where the supernatural exists, unarmed combat has additional uses. Attacking with techniques from this category without proficiency provokes attacks of opportunity from trained combatants. Proficiency with an unarmed combat technique allows the use that technique with no penalty even when wielding weapons not specifically designed for it or when wielding no weapon at all.

**Disarm**ing is the act of liberating a foe of their weapon. Also grants proficiency with "sunder". Ranged weapons cannot be used for disarming or sundering. It follows the rules set out in "Basic Martial Manoeuvres".

**Grapple** is the act of restricting the movement of your foe using your body or held items. It covers the "grapple" and "restrain" manoeuvres and follows the "Basic Martial Manoeuvres" rules.

**Strikes** are the use of appendages or protruding body parts to deal bludgeoning or piercing damage to a target.

**Throw** is the act of moving your foe around the battlefield or throwing them down. It follows the "Basic Martial Manoeuvres" rules. It also gives proficiency with "shove" and "trip" manoeuvres.

### Light blades

This is something of a misnomer. Light blades refers to smaller one handed bladed weapons that weight no more than 2lb. It also refers to certain thrown weapons whose use similar to that of bladed weapons. Light blades  are typically easily hidden. All light blades can cause "bleeding". Not all light blades have the light properties.

**Dagger**s include kitchen knives, hunting knives, daggers and similar blades. They are often somewhat throwable. Daggers have the "light" property.

**Scimitar**s are curved blades designed for cutting and chopping. Scimitars, sabres, kodachi, kukri and machetes all fall in this category. can cause the "crippled" condition.

**Short Sword**s are short straight blades designed primarily for stabbing. They are simple, sturdy blades. The gladius is a typical short sword.

**Small Sword**s are light, elegant blades designed specifically for piercing. They are typically used by ranking members of high and low society for tidily settling scores and are not meant for heavy combat. They have the "light" and "disarm" properties. As an exception, small swords do NOT cause "bleeding" (as in they cause bleeding, but not "bleeding"). **NB**: The "rapier" from DnD 3.5 onwards is in fact a small sword.

**Shuriken** refers to throwing needles, throwing knives and throwing stars. These are easily concealed blades used for surprise attacks and as a distraction. They have the "light" property.

### Heavy blades

These are the legendary blades of legend, and the symbol of a warrior. Heavy blades are fearsome bladed weapons. All items in this category except Falchions are "long". All heavy blades cause "bleeding".

**Rapiers** are long blades designed for keeping enemies at a distance and inflicting deep, piercing wounds. Rapiers have the "disarm" property.

**Falchions** are long, curved blades with a single edge. Katanas and cutlasses are also considered falchions here. Falchions can cause "cripple".

**Longswords** are the most iconic of swords. They represent longswords, broadswords, hand-and-a-half swords and greatswords (!!). Longswords can cause "cripple".

**Greatswords** represent claymores and zweihanders rather than classical "greatswords". They can be used to cut with the blade and bludgeon with the weighty pommel. These are "heavy" weapons which can, and will cause "cripple".


### Staves

Staves are round poles with a length between 4-8ft. Staves are bludgeoning weapons that can also be used for support when "crippled" or on difficult terrain. They particularly useful for non-lethal combat. Staves can cause "cripple" and "prone".

**Quarterstaff**: This is a two handed weapon between 6-8ft long. It has the "reach" and enables the "throw" manoeuvre.

**Shortstaff**: This is a short staff between 4-6ft long. The shortened length allows a great deal of manoeuvres to be executed with this weapon. It has the "long" property and enables "throw", "grapple" and "disarm".

### Slings

Slings are simple in construction and difficult in exploitation which make use centripetal force. A sling is essentially a length of sinew with a "nest" for the projectile (usually a round stone or metal bullet) at the center. Despite the range, slings are difficult to aim and therefore have a low range increment. Slings can also be used to shoot stones, in absence of proper ammunition, but the attack is at disadvantage. Slings have the "light" and "unwieldy" properties.

### Bows

Bows are curved ranged weapon, that, when strung appears as a length of material, bent into a curve by a string from its two extremities. This is one of the most common and effective ranged weapons used in most realms. Bows are quite delicate weapons and easily ruined by poor handling or attacks aimed to sunder them. All bows cause "bleeding". Bows have the "delicate" property. On a critical miss, the bow takes 1 point of damage.

**Shortbows** represent actual shortbows, as well as simple, low draw weight bows that do not fall into other categories. Shortbow attacks can cause "bleeding". Typically they are used for hunting and banditry.

**Composite bows** represent bows made of several layers of different materials and constructed in a special curved shape to maximise the power of the bow for its size. They are typically used by mounted archers and have the "mounted" property.

**Longbows** are large bows made to shoot heavy arrows over a large distance. Their construction is quite simple and they are a comparatively inexpensive weapon. Longbows have the "unwieldy" property. Longbows require great strength to use properly. For every point of Str bonus below +2 that the character has, it has a -1 penalty for attacks with longbows and the range it can use the weapon at decreases by one range increment.

**Greatbows** are a large, asymmetric composite bow made for maximum power while still allowing use on horseback. Greatbows have the "unwieldy" and "mounted" property. Greatbows require great strength to use properly. For every point of Str bonus below +2 that the character has, it has a -1 penalty for attacks with greatbows and the range it can use the weapon at decreases by one range increment.

## Armour

  - Full Padded
  - Leather Cuirass
  - Chain Shirt
- **Medium armours**
  - Full Leather
  - Hide armour

#### Armour Proficiencies

Any entity whose body fits a suit of armour can wear the armour. As such it will get the normal benefit to the hit threshold.

- When an entity dons or doffs an armour it is not proficient with, it takes twice as long to don and doff the armour as normal.
- While an entity is wearing an armour it is not proficient with it takes a -5 penalty to all [DEX] and [STR] based rolls it makes.

Armour and its properties are further discussed in the "Weapons and Armour Section".

There are three armour proficiencies that each cover several groups of armour.

## Disclaimer

I am not experienced with weapons outside of bows and staves, and nor am I a scholar of medieval weapons. Therefore this chapter should be taken with pinch of salt with regards to historical realism.
